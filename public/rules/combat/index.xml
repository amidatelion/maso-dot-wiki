Combat is broken into turns, which run in a dynamic initiative order. Everyone involved in combat gets 1 turn, which is broken up into actions: 1 move action, 1 major action, 1 minor action and free actions. These can be taken in any order.</description></item><item><title>Initiative</title><link>http://localhost:1313/rules/combat/initiative/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/rules/combat/initiative/</guid><description>Initiative isn’t rolled for or set like some games. It is seized, which means whoever wants to go next, can. On the first round of combat, someone seizes the “first” position. If two people want that position, one or the other can concede or they roll off. A seize roll is 3d6 + any modifiers. Ties result in another roll off. The process repeats until everyone has seized a place in the initiative order.</description></item><item><title>The Turn</title><link>http://localhost:1313/rules/combat/the-turn/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/rules/combat/the-turn/</guid><description>A turn is 1 move action, 1 major action, 1 minor action and free actions, taken in any order.
Move Action # A move action allows a player to move up to their speed in any valid direction. If they are in a vehicle, they move at the vehicle’s speed. Terrain or other effects may reduce this speed, but nothing may increase it. Instead, a player may push themselves or their vehicle.</description></item><item><title>Movement</title><link>http://localhost:1313/rules/combat/movement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/rules/combat/movement/</guid><description>A player may move their speed in combat.
Infantry Movement # Infantry have great flexibility in movement. Unburdened infantry move their speed horizontally across any terrain, though that terrain may force checks that can affect their speed. Infantry that are overloaded also move at half their speed.
Infantry can ascend 1 level vertically with appropriate tools - i.e. a ladder, pitons, etc. Certain surfaces can be climbed by without tooling and a relevant check.</description></item><item><title>Attacks</title><link>http://localhost:1313/rules/combat/attacks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/rules/combat/attacks/</guid><description>Attacks are a Nerves check on 3d6 against a target 15 with any relevant modifiers. This includes the player’s modifiers and the target’s, of which there can be many, and is where the complexity in M.A.S.O really comes from. Aside from weapon modifiers, here are some common ones
Size Differences # Targets gain size penalties and bonuses based on size differences. For every size category that a target is larger than the player, the player gets a +1 bonus against.</description></item><item><title>Damage</title><link>http://localhost:1313/rules/combat/damage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/rules/combat/damage/</guid><description>Damage can broadly be split into Infantry and Vehicle Damage models.
Infantry Damage # Damage against a person or beast or really anything organic is done against their HP and usually blocked by armour. Infantry armour blocks damage. So when a shot connects, it does its damage first to the armour and then to the wearer’s hit points. Hit points are defined your Body stat - namely 5 x your Body (minimum of 10).</description></item><item><title>Morale</title><link>http://localhost:1313/rules/combat/morale/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/rules/combat/morale/</guid><description>Unit Morale is invisibly tracked on a scale from 0 to 20. That is, the GM tracks it and it is invisible to the players.
Morale starts at the beginning of a campaign at a level determined by the GM and can be increased by player actions and decreased by enemy actions (or, with really bad roles/plans, player actions). If morale ever hits 0 a Zero Morale Event happens. This is bad.</description></item></channel></rss>
