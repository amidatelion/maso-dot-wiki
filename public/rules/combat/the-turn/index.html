<a class=anchor href=#move-action>#</a></h1><p>A move action allows a player to move up to their speed in any valid direction. If they are in a vehicle, they move at the vehicle’s speed. Terrain or other effects may reduce this speed, but nothing may increase it. Instead, a player may push themselves or their vehicle.</p><h1 id=major-action>Major Action
<a class=anchor href=#major-action>#</a></h1><p>A major action involves engaging in combat. Shooting, attacking in melee, throwing a grenade, any of these things are major actions. A vehicle may fire all of its weapons once as a major action - subsequent actions from pushing it allow it to fire 1 weapon 1 additional time. A Major action is worth 2 Minor or 2 Move actions - this is relevant to Pushing Yourself</p><h1 id=minor-action>Minor Action
<a class=anchor href=#minor-action>#</a></h1><p>A minor action is any active action that isn’t directly offensive. Reloading, deploying a drone, doing a scan, any of these are minor actions. See Pushing Yourself.</p><h1 id=free-actions>Free Actions
<a class=anchor href=#free-actions>#</a></h1><p>A free action is any action that is pure flavour, such as banter, posing, kissing a lucky charm, etc. They are time limited based on the GM or player’s judgement and you generally can only do 1 per round.</p><h1 id=pushing-yourself>Pushing Yourself
<a class=anchor href=#pushing-yourself>#</a></h1><p>Any time a player wants to achieve more in a fight, they are welcome to push themselves. This grants them 1 further Major action. A Major action is worth 2 Minor or 2 Move actions. However, as infantry, they must roll on the Infantry consequences table to see if pushing themselves had any negative effects. As vehicles, they increment their heat by 1.</p><h3 id=infantry-consequences>Infantry Consequences

<a class=anchor href=#individual-fallout>#</a></h1><p><strong>Nothing… happens?:</strong> You really need me to explain this to you? Consider this a warning.<br><strong>Ankle sprain:</strong> The individual’s movement speed is reduced by half.<br><strong>Muscle tremors:</strong> Overexertion has taken its toll on your body. Any Nerves rolls take a -1 penalty for the remainder of the fight.<br><strong>Bone Fracture:</strong> Now you’ve done it. You slammed into something or held a gun wrong and you’ve fractured a bone. Any Body rolls take a -1 penalty for the remainder of the fight.<br><strong>Exhausted:</strong> You’ve really pushed yourself(ves) past your limits. Take the indicated penalty to all actions for 10 rounds, or 5 rounds without movement. This stacks and resets the count.<br><strong>Worsened Condition:</strong> Any penalties you have taken are incremented by 1. This does not affect time periods. If you have no penalties, nothing happens.<br><strong>Disoriented:</strong> The whiplash of your faster than normal acts have left you confused. The GM may control the direction of your movement or target of an attack for 1 round.<br><strong>Injury!:</strong> You immediately take an injury.<br><strong>Hyped:</strong> Yo, did you see that move?! You’re running high on adrenaline. For the next 3 rounds you have a +1 to all rolls. This stacks and resets the round counter.</p></div><div class="flex-even markdown-inner"><h1 id=squad-fallout>Squad Fallout
<a class=anchor href=#squad-fallout>#</a></h1><p><strong>Member slowed:</strong> A member of the squad’s speed is reduced by half. The squad can either match their speed or leave the member behind.
<strong>Ammo loss:</strong> In the hectic rush, all members lose 1 reload of their weapons. If a heavy weapon is present, on a roll of 4+ on a d6, it loses a reload as well.<br><strong>Member Injured!:</strong> Someone slipped and fell, giving themselves a concussion or some other piece of battlefield bad luck. They are out of the fight.<br><strong>Gone Prone:</strong> Someone slipped and feel, but this time everyone assumes they’ve been downed by something and go prone to avoid the same fate. The squad is rendered immobile, but gain Light Cover.<br><strong>Disobediance:</strong> You pushed the squad too hard and now they’re irascible. They may refuse to move, take different action than the one you intend, or worse. GM’s choice. This also damage’s the company’s Morale by -1.<br><strong>Morale:</strong> You all are so good at your jobs, you feel like you can do anything. For the next 3 rounds you have the indicated bonus to all rolls. This stacks and resets the round counter. Additionally, whatever the highest Morale modifier the squad achieves is carried over to the company’s morale at the end of combat.</p></div></div></p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#infantry-consequences>Infantry Consequences</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
