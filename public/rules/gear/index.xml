Mostly they are vests, but more elaborated fits exist. Armors have an Armor Value (AV). They block damage based on that AV. Note that many ammunitions have a Penetration Value (PV) that bypass certain amounts of AV.
Examples: Jay is wearing Kevlar, which has an AV of 3. He is shot by a pistol shooting QuakeMaker ammo which has a PV of 0.</description></item></channel></rss>
