The baseline of all of these is zero, with each point granting a bonus on rolls associated with it. These are fairly self explanatory and but a cursory explanation follows:
Body: Represents feats of strength and endurance.
Nerves: Represents feats of precision and reflexes.
Wit: Represents feats of mental and interpersonal nature.
Increasing Stats # The cost to increase Stats increases logarhythmically.</description></item><item><title>Dice and Rolls</title><link>http://localhost:1313/rules/basics/dice-and-rolls/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/rules/basics/dice-and-rolls/</guid><description>You only need 1 type of die for M.A.S.O. - but preferably 3d6. But you can make do with just the one.
All checks, whether they be attack rolls or skill checks, are done on 3d6 and target 15 for success. These checks are modified by the situation, stats and perks.</description></item><item><title>Character Generation</title><link>http://localhost:1313/rules/basics/character-generation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/rules/basics/character-generation/</guid><description>Introduction # A character is almost entirely role-played. When creating a character your effort should be on developing their past and career. From there it makes choosing your stats and traits much easier and you have a more rounded character at the end of it.
Generation # On generation, a character has 1 positive trait, 1 negative trait and 1 trade-off trait to define their skills with.They may also “purchase” more positive traits by also taking negative ones.</description></item><item><title>Player "Classes"</title><link>http://localhost:1313/rules/basics/player-classes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/rules/basics/player-classes/</guid><description>Drivers # Drivers can vary from ferryfolk driving Infantry Fighting Vehicles to tank drivers. They are flexible in their job description and very aware that their rides can get blown out from under them in the blink of an eye. As such they’re among the most hard-bitten, devil-may-care characters. Think of the tank commander holding his shot under fire until a mech exposes a weak-spot or the IFV driver drifting her ride up against a building to provide safe cover for infantry loading up hostages.</description></item></channel></rss>
