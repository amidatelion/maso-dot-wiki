<a class=anchor href=#drivers>#</a></h2><p>Drivers can vary from ferryfolk driving Infantry Fighting Vehicles to tank drivers. They are flexible in their job description and very aware that their rides can get blown out from under them in the blink of an eye. As such they’re among the most hard-bitten, devil-may-care characters. Think of the tank commander holding his shot under fire until a mech exposes a weak-spot or the IFV driver drifting her ride up against a building to provide safe cover for infantry loading up hostages.</p><p>Role-playing wise a driver is likely to be a single individual, though some larger tanks may require a crew. It’s up to the player to sort out how they want to handle this with the GM and it’s recommended that they be able to see the Infantry player struggle with RPing a squad first or at least have some communal RP experience from commanding The Commander first.</p><p>Gameplay-wise these drivers tend towards min-maxing, if you can call it that. They are the most likely to be exposed to danger in the relatively flimsiest vehicles and so work themselves, their environment and the rules to the max to ensure their survival and that of their charges. Though there’s something to be said for being a generalist when your ride is constantly being blown out from underneath you.</p><h2 id=pilots>Pilots
<a class=anchor href=#pilots>#</a></h2><h3 id=aircraft-pilots>Aircraft Pilots
<a class=anchor href=#aircraft-pilots>#</a></h3><p>Once seekers of matchless glory, aircraft pilots have fallen a long way from their glamorous positions in the 20th century. No longer are they the hot shots, the kings and queens of the sky. Indeed, they have taken on a more pedestrian role of support and defenders. When the infantry need help, they are the ones most likely to be able to respond quickly. But real glory comes from defensive operations, when landbound targets are under fire. When the skies darken with drop pods and aerospace fighters, the aircraft pilots come into their own.</p><p>RP-wise aircraft pilots are still how’d you imagine a modern-day fighter pilot, though tempered by the knowledge that they’re basically the meat in a munitions sandwich. They crack wise and are often laid-back, as there’s little to do when a planet isn’t under attack - how one reacts to being forced out of this surety could be something to explore. While it&rsquo;s possible for a player to play a “fat” bird like a cargo plane or gunship, it’s unlikely. Talk to your GM.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, Aircraft pilots are kings and queens of Nerves. They live and die by the stat, using their unmatched atmospheric maneuverability to dust aerospace fighters, dodge missiles and deflect lasers. There are devices that allow insertion of aircraft into atmosphere from space and even recovery, though during transit you’re basically a sitting duck.</p><p>Note: VTOL fall roughly into this category and a bit into drivers - not very fleshed out.</p><h3 id=helicopter-pilots>Helicopter Pilots
<a class=anchor href=#helicopter-pilots>#</a></h3><h3 id=vtol-pilots>VTOL Pilots
<a class=anchor href=#vtol-pilots>#</a></h3><h2 id=boat-drivers>Boat drivers
<a class=anchor href=#boat-drivers>#</a></h2><p>Navy fuckers.</p><h2 id=infantry>Infantry
<a class=anchor href=#infantry>#</a></h2><p>You’re meat before the grinder, men and women clad in paper armour and with small arms standing before armour and giants. But since the first human picked up a rock to kill another, there’s been that other hardass that could still kill them barehanded. The pilots trust in their steel, but you, you have to trust in your skill and each other.</p><p>The infantry player is actually one of the more complex roles in M.A.S.O., as they must be, by design, in command of a squad. This complicates the role-playing aspect - how much detail do you go into about the squad? How large is it? How focused are you on the infantry commander vs the rest of the squad?</p><p>Gameplay-wise Infantry players are indispensable to M.A.S.O. operations because fundamentally they can go places others can’t go and do things that pilots can’t do. They can explore ruins or collapsed buildings or rescue civilians or root out opposition that holds a command centre. Everything above is the hammer. You are the nail.</p><h2 id=non-combat-characters>Non-Combat Characters
<a class=anchor href=#non-combat-characters>#</a></h2><p>You might not want to play a combat character or want to take a break from combat from time to time, and that’s perfectly fair. Non-combat characters are welcome and are designed to fill gaps in the RP or gameplay experience that will naturally come about from having a bunch of violence-oriented individuals played in an RPG. You are welcome to talk with your GM to develop a character that fills a niche on the crew that the above classes overlook. A dedicated diplomat for smoothing jobs over, for example, or a communications expert to run ELINT or perhaps drones.</p><p>Be warned though, these people are still in a military - they will come under fire eventually. It is on you how they respond to that.</p><p>RP-wise, the floor is open. The breadth of non-combat characters is impossible to summarize - talk to your GM if you’re having trouble nailing one down - they probably have a niche in mind that would be good to fill or angle towards.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, you will be defined by your traits more than any other player. Make them characterful, make them useful and manipulate situations to allow you to use them as often as possible.
