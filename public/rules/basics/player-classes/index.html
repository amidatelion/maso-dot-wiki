<h1>Player &#34;Classes&#34;</h1>

<h1 id="drivers">Drivers</h1>
<p>Drivers can vary from ferryfolk driving Infantry Fighting Vehicles to tank drivers. They are flexible in their job description and very aware that their rides can get blown out from under them in the blink of an eye. As such they’re among the most hard-bitten, devil-may-care characters. Think of the tank commander holding his shot under fire until a mech exposes a weak-spot or the IFV driver drifting her ride up against a building to provide safe cover for infantry loading up hostages.</p>
<p>Role-playing wise a driver is likely to be a single individual, though some larger tanks may require a crew. It’s up to the player to sort out how they want to handle this with the GM and it’s recommended that they be able to see the Infantry player struggle with RPing a squad first or at least have some communal RP experience from commanding The Commander first.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise these drivers tend towards min-maxing, if you can call it that. They are the most likely to be exposed to danger in the relatively flimsiest vehicles and so work themselves, their environment and the rules to the max to ensure their survival and that of their charges. Though there’s something to be said for being a generalist when your ride is constantly being blown out from underneath you.</p>
<h1 id="pilots">Pilots</h1>
<h2 id="aircraft-pilots">Aircraft Pilots</h2>
<p>Once seekers of matchless glory, aircraft pilots have fallen a long way from their glamorous positions in the 20th century. No longer are they the hot shots, the kings and queens of the sky. Indeed, they have taken on a more pedestrian role of support and defenders. When the infantry need help, they are the ones most likely to be able to respond quickly. But real glory comes from defensive operations, when landbound targets are under fire. When the skies darken with drop pods and aerospace fighters, the aircraft pilots come into their own.</p>
<p>RP-wise aircraft pilots are still how’d you imagine a modern-day fighter pilot, though tempered by the knowledge that they’re basically the meat in a munitions sandwich. They crack wise and are often laid-back, as there’s little to do when a planet isn’t under attack - how one reacts to being forced out of this surety could be something to explore. While it&rsquo;s possible for a player to play a “fat” bird like a cargo plane or gunship, it’s unlikely. Talk to your GM.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, Aircraft pilots are kings and queens of Reaction. They live and die by the stat, using their unmatched atmospheric maneuverability to dust aerospace fighters, dodge missiles and deflect lasers. There are devices that allow insertion of aircraft into atmosphere from space and even recovery, though during transit you’re basically a sitting duck.</p>
<p>Note: VTOL fall roughly into this category and a bit into drivers - not very fleshed out.</p>
<h2 id="spacecraft-pilots">Spacecraft Pilots</h2>
<p>It’s you and the black out here. Though all branches of all forces have pilot-recovery protocols and drill them rigorously, space is a very, very big place. It’s a sobering thought that one second, one wrong move, could condemn you to drifting in the black for the rest of your (short) life. Thankfully, spacecraft tend to be hardier than aircraft and have eight degrees of freedom to dodge in.</p>
<p>Roleplaying-wise spacecraft pilots lack the traditions and history of their airbound brethren and so have had to form their own. A tradition that has tended towards insularity and being protective of one another - the sphere formation of the The Hauberi-Coronand War is a good example of this being put into action, or a bar fight suddenly turning into a 1-on-12.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise spacecraft pilots work similarly to aircraft pilots, though in place of Reaction, they rely on Smarts because their maneuvers can be mentally taxing - you try to keep track of your fighter, the enemy, free-whirling debris and frictionless movement in any direction in space.</p>
<h2 id="aerospace-pilots">Aerospace Pilots</h2>
<p>Here be the jocks, the speed demons, those that live on the edge. Less maneuverable in air and space than their counterparts, they’ve turned towards their one major advantage - Fuck. Huge. Engines. An aerospace fighter is approximately 70% engine with weapons tacked on as convenient and armour being an afterthought. But goddamn can they move.</p>
<p>RP-wise, these are the elite. You need to be qualified in aircraft before you’re even allowed to train on aerospace craft. And because of the inherent disadvantage that those pilots suffer from vis-a-vis other craft, generally only the best of the best are chosen. They are also rare, as the mortality rate of these lightly armoured pilots is unfortunately high. There is something fae to these pilots, and something dangerous.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, you’re barely going to be on the board. The absurd power of the crafts’ engines, designed to get them back into orbit after a mission means that what they lack in immediate maneuverability they make up for hard attack angles and board-spanning reach. As they are exceptionally reliant on their gear, Smarts matters, but Body won’t go amiss either. What’s 6Gs? Breakfast, scrub.</p>
<p>Note: it is entirely possible that instead of an aerospace fighter you might be a dropship or gunship pilot. Talk to the GM about those possibilities.</p>
<h1 id="walkers">Walkers</h1>
<p>Yeah, I know what you’re here for. The new ground-pounders, the Walkers-in-Steel. To pilot a Mech is to hook into a VR-infosphere that makes you feel like a giant on the battlefield. Overconfidence is your wont as you mount more armour than a tank and more weapons besides while being the biggest target on the ground. But ask any mech pilot, they wouldn’t give it up for the world - they are the gods of war in the Star Era. They know it, the public knows it and they are often at the forefront of the media.</p>
<p>RP-wise, as much as bravado is part-and-parcel of a being a mech pilot, it is drilled into them that they are entrusted with the firepower of at least a platoon up to an entire tank battalion, to be dispensed from their fingertips. The young tend to be cocky and tactically interested, the old reserved and wise, easing well into strategic roles. Through their experience on the battlefield and their wealth of sensor knowledge, they are often second-in-command on the ground if no better option exists.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, your experience will differ from light to medium to heavy mechs. You could switch from being a scout to a trooper to a battlefield monster, but a few things remain the same. Movement is life, weapons are hot and getting surrounded gets you killed. You are the hammer, but without your fellows on the battlefield, you will be taken down. With prejudice.</p>
<h1 id="infantry">Infantry</h1>
<p>You’re meat before the grinder, men and women clad in paper armour and with small arms standing before armour and giants. But since the first human picked up a rock to kill another, there’s been that other hardass that could still kill them barehanded. The pilots trust in their steel, but you, you have to trust in your skill and each other.</p>
<p>The infantry player is actually one of the more complex roles in M.A.S.O., as they must be, by design, in command of a squad. This complicates the role-playing aspect - how much detail do you go into about the squad? How large is it? How focused are you on the infantry commander vs the rest of the squad?</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise Infantry players are indispensable to M.A.S.O. operations because fundamentally they can go places others can’t go and do things that pilots can’t do. They can explore ruins or collapsed buildings or rescue civilians or root out opposition that holds a command centre. Everything above is the hammer. You are the nail.</p>
<h1 id="non-combat-characters">Non-Combat Characters</h1>
<p>You might not want to play a combat character or want to take a break from combat from time to time, and that’s perfectly fair. Non-combat characters are welcome and are designed to fill gaps in the RP or gameplay experience that will naturally come about from having a bunch of violence-oriented individuals played in an RPG. You are welcome to talk with your GM to develop a character that fills a niche on the crew that the above classes overlook. A dedicated diplomat for smoothing jobs over, for example, or a communications expert to run ELINT or perhaps drones.</p>
<p>Be warned though, these people are still in a military - they will come under fire eventually. It is on you how they respond to that.</p>
<p>RP-wise, the floor is open. The breadth of non-combat characters is impossible to summarize - talk to your GM if you’re having trouble nailing one down - they probably have a niche in mind that would be good to fill or angle towards.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, you will be defined by your traits more than any other player. Make them characterful, make them useful and manipulate situations to allow you to use them as often as possible.</p>
<h1 id="secondary-characters">Secondary Characters</h1>
<p>Now, it might be that everyone wants to play combat characters and the party is really feeling the need for some RP opportunities that would be better served by a non-combat character. Or perhaps they’re made available at the opening of the campaign or for a particular subsection. Either way, if you’re playing an NCC as a secondary character, it should be one of two ways:

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    One Each: <em>You</em> get a secondary character and <em>you</em> get a secondary character and <em>you</em> get a- &hellip; Yeah. Functionally, no one should be left out of this opportunity - it&rsquo;s not fun when one person or a subset of people get extra RP opportunities.
</div>


<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    Commander Model: The secondary character is shared among the group like The Commander, as per below.
</div>
</p>
<h1 id="the-commander">The Commander</h1>
<p>One of M.A.S.O.’s conceits is the figure of The Commander - a shared NPC that all the players control and have input on. The Commander is the one giving the orders and is the primary story driver. That’s not to say individual player characters aren’t important - but they’re important on the tactical or day-to-day level, which informs the higher storytelling or week-to-week level.</p>
<p>The Commander is played by the GM and the players in committee. To do so they enter the Commander’s Headspace. The GM will often kick this off with a premise or problem the Commander is mulling over, like where to go next. But, and this is important, players should feel that they can call for Headspace time. In Headspace, the given situation is discussed and a decision is come to by the player with the input of the GM. Two things to note here:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Headspace issue must end with a decision, policy or act for the Commander to&hellip; action.</li>
<li>The GM has input but should not drive the discussion. They are the repository of The Commander’s personality and knowledge but should not use this to constantly override player decisions, simply to steer them. 
Only if a group cannot agree on an action can the GM decide the matter, choosing the least offensive option and thereby pissing everyone off. Them’s the breaks.<br>
