Combat is broken into turns, which run in a dynamic initiative order. Everyone involved in combat gets 1 turn, which is broken up into actions: 1 move action, 1 major action, 1 minor action and free actions. These can be taken in any order.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/rules/basics/pc/","title":"The Player Character","section":"Basic Rules","content":" Stats # There are only three stats in M.A.S.O - Body, Nerves, and Wit. The baseline of all of these is zero, with each point granting a bonus on rolls associated with it. These are fairly self explanatory and but a cursory explanation follows:\nBody: Represents feats of strength and endurance.\nNerves: Represents feats of precision and reflexes.\nWit: Represents feats of mental and interpersonal nature.\nIncreasing Stats # The cost to increase Stats increases logarhythmically. For the purposes of this run, consider Stats capped at 5, though the GM could be convinced to go beyond. For comparison, an Olympian is probably a 7. In the greater M.A.S.O ruleset, anything 8 or higher is considered Peak Human and usually requires genetic modification to accomplish.\nStat Number # 0-\u0026gt;1\n1-\u0026gt;2\n2-\u0026gt;3\n3-\u0026gt;4\n4-\u0026gt;5\nPoint Cost # 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nTraits # Traits are where the character modifications come from in M.A.S.O. You’ll note that Body, Nerves and Wit are pretty limited in what they describe. They are also numerically limited. Traits are characteristics that grant situational modifiers that better describe what a character’s capabilities are. There are positive traits, trade-off traits and negative traits. A positive trait grants +1 to rolls on subjects mentioned in the trait. A trade-off grants +1 to some rolls and -1 to others. A negative trait grants -1 to rolls on subjects mentioned in the trait. Trade-off traits are generally only granted on character creation or by the GM for situations and behaviours as they see fit.\nOn character generation, a player gets 1 positive trait, and a trade-off trait. A trade-off trait have equal positives and negatives. They may also “purchase” more positive traits by also taking negative ones. This is capped at 3 for character generation but otherwise, no cap exists.\nTraits should be characterful and represent a character’s experience - they can describe any situation, inside or outside of combat. See the sample characters for ideas.\nInjuries # A player has 2 injuries available to them to start. These are only used in combat and are mitigated by hit points. Even if you get into a bar fight, you will not take an injury. I mean, unless you escalate the situation.\nGaining injuries is under development.\nHit Points # Hit points are defined your Body stat - namely 10 x your Body (minimum of 10). Once a player’s hit points are depleted, they take an injury and their hit points reset.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/rules/combat/","title":"Combat Rules","section":"Rules","content":" Herein are the combat rules of MASO - things thing gon\u0026rsquo; get crunchy.

These checks are modified by the situation, stats and perks.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/rules/combat/initiative/","title":"Initiative","section":"Combat Rules","content":"Initiative isn’t rolled for or set like some games. It is seized, which means whoever wants to go next, can. On the first round of combat, someone seizes the “first” position. If two people want that position, one or the other can concede or they roll off. A seize roll is 3d6 + any modifiers. Ties result in another roll off. The process repeats until everyone has seized a place in the initiative order. If a player fails to seize the initiative, they take a cumulative -1 to all seize rolls, all of which can be removed by deferring to a lower initiative order as they back off and regroup.\nPlayers can remain in this initiative order for the remainder of combat, or they can defer or try to seize a higher initiative position each round. Deferring simply means dropping to a lower initiative position of their choice. Seizing a new position is a roll-off, with some extra steps. The seizing player rolls as normal and the “defending” player gets a bonus based on how many positions are between them and the seizing player.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/rules/basics/character-generation/","title":"Character Generation","section":"Basic Rules","content":" Introduction # A character is almost entirely role-played. When creating a character your effort should be on developing their past and career.

They also have three Ability Points. These can be split between stats and licenses.

Everyone in M.A.S.O. starts with a Basic License. Congrats, you can drive a car, and therefore tanks, IFVs and all basic vehicles. Licenses sometimes have prerequisites, as seen on the tables below:\nLicense # Basic\nTank\nAircraft\nHelicopter\nVTOL\nDrones*\nWatercraft*\nShips\nCapital Ships\nEnables # Traditional land vehicles\nTread\nJet, prop or other aircraft\nRotor craft\nVTOL aircraft\nFine control of drones\nFine control of small boats\nUp to frigates\nUp to carriers\nRequires # N/A\nBasic\nBasic\nBasic\nAircraft or Helicopter\nBasic\nBasic\nWatercraft\nShips\n* Can be operated without license - problems will crop up\nNote: On first glance this gives infantry a statistical advantage and dedicated tank/vehicle drivers especially. However, given the sheer firepower disadvantage they face, this is basically required. Even a tank driver might be blown free of a tank much more quickly than a mech pilot and so will have to rely on their Body, Nerves and Wit without mechanical aid more.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/rules/gear/","title":"Gear","section":"Rules","content":" Get you some gurrrrrrrrr "},{"id":8,"href":"/rules/combat/the-turn/","title":"The Turn","section":"Combat Rules","content":"A turn is 1 move action, 1 major action, 1 minor action and free actions, taken in any order.\nMove Action # A move action allows a player to move up to their speed in any valid direction. If they are in a vehicle, they move at the vehicle’s speed. Terrain or other effects may reduce this speed, but nothing may increase it. Instead, a player may push themselves or their vehicle.\nMajor Action # A major action involves engaging in combat. Shooting, attacking in melee, throwing a grenade, any of these things are major actions. A vehicle may fire all of its weapons once as a major action - subsequent actions from pushing it allow it to fire 1 weapon 1 additional time. A Major action is worth 2 Minor or 2 Move actions - this is relevant to Pushing Yourself\nMinor Action # A minor action is any active action that isn’t directly offensive. Reloading, deploying a drone, doing a scan, any of these are minor actions. See Pushing Yourself.\nFree Actions # A free action is any action that is pure flavour, such as banter, posing, kissing a lucky charm, etc. They are time limited based on the GM or player’s judgement and you generally can only do 1 per round.\nPushing Yourself # Any time a player wants to achieve more in a fight, they are welcome to push themselves. This grants them 1 further Major action. A Major action is worth 2 Minor or 2 Move actions.

Consider this a warning.\nAnkle sprain: The individual’s movement speed is reduced by half. Muscle tremors: Overexertion has taken its toll on your body. Any Nerves rolls take a -1 penalty for the remainder of the fight. Bone Fracture: Now you’ve done it. You slammed into something or held a gun wrong and you’ve fractured a bone. Any Body rolls take a -1 penalty for the remainder of the fight.\nExhausted: You’ve really pushed yourself(ves) past your limits. Take the indicated penalty to all actions for 10 rounds, or 5 rounds without movement. This stacks and resets the count.\nWorsened Condition: Any penalties you have taken are incremented by 1. This does not affect time periods. If you have no penalties, nothing happens.\nDisoriented: The whiplash of your faster than normal acts have left you confused. The GM may control the direction of your movement or target of an attack for 1 round.\nInjury!: You immediately take an injury.\nHyped: Yo, did you see that move?! You’re running high on adrenaline. For the next 3 rounds you have a +1 to all rolls. This stacks and resets the round counter.\nSquad Fallout # Member slowed: A member of the squad’s speed is reduced by half. The squad can either match their speed or leave the member behind. Ammo loss: In the hectic rush, all members lose 1 reload of their weapons. If a heavy weapon is present, on a roll of 4+ on a d6, it loses a reload as well.\nMember Injured!: Someone slipped and fell, giving themselves a concussion or some other piece of battlefield bad luck. They are out of the fight.\nGone Prone: Someone slipped and feel, but this time everyone assumes they’ve been downed by something and go prone to avoid the same fate. The squad is rendered immobile, but gain Light Cover.\nDisobediance: You pushed the squad too hard and now they’re irascible. They may refuse to move, take different action than the one you intend, or worse. GM’s choice. This also damage’s the company’s Morale by -1.\nMorale: You all are so good at your jobs, you feel like you can do anything. For the next 3 rounds you have the indicated bonus to all rolls. This stacks and resets the round counter.

Unburdened infantry move their speed horizontally across any terrain, though that terrain may force checks that can affect their speed. Infantry that are overloaded also move at half their speed.\nInfantry can ascend 1 level vertically with appropriate tools - i.e. a ladder, pitons, etc. Certain surfaces can be climbed by without tooling and a relevant check.\nVehicle Movement # In a vehicle, players have three speeds: combat, cruising, flat out, noted on the sheet. A combat speed is slowest, but allows for the best maneuverability and is always available. Cruising is meant for covering large distance and in order to enter cruising speed, a vehicle must have spent 1 round at combat speed as it takes time to accelerate. To move at cruising speed, a pilot must use 1 move action to move, and 1 more to move at cruising. A pilot making anything more than basic course adjustments must succeed on a Nerves check against a target of 10.\nFlat out works similarly, except that for every round the vehicle has spent in flat out, its heat increments by one. To move at flat out speed, a pilot must use 1 move action to move, and 2 more to move at flat out. Even basic maneuvering during flat out speeds requires a Nerves check against a target of 10 and making complex course corrections must be made against a target of 15.\nTerrain and the environment may impede movement. Difficult terrain halves speed and dangerous terrain causes effects listed or described by the GM.\n"},{"id":10,"href":"/rules/basics/player-classes/","title":"Player \"Classes\"","section":"Basic Rules","content":" Drivers # Drivers can vary from ferryfolk driving Infantry Fighting Vehicles to tank drivers. They are flexible in their job description and very aware that their rides can get blown out from under them in the blink of an eye. As such they’re among the most hard-bitten, devil-may-care characters. Think of the tank commander holding his shot under fire until a mech exposes a weak-spot or the IFV driver drifting her ride up against a building to provide safe cover for infantry loading up hostages.\nRole-playing wise a driver is likely to be a single individual, though some larger tanks may require a crew. It’s up to the player to sort out how they want to handle this with the GM and it’s recommended that they be able to see the Infantry player struggle with RPing a squad first or at least have some communal RP experience from commanding The Commander first.\nGameplay-wise these drivers tend towards min-maxing, if you can call it that. They are the most likely to be exposed to danger in the relatively flimsiest vehicles and so work themselves, their environment and the rules to the max to ensure their survival and that of their charges. Though there’s something to be said for being a generalist when your ride is constantly being blown out from underneath you.\nPilots # Aircraft Pilots # Once seekers of matchless glory, aircraft pilots have fallen a long way from their glamorous positions in the 20th century. No longer are they the hot shots, the kings and queens of the sky. Indeed, they have taken on a more pedestrian role of support and defenders. When the infantry need help, they are the ones most likely to be able to respond quickly. But real glory comes from defensive operations, when landbound targets are under fire. When the skies darken with drop pods and aerospace fighters, the aircraft pilots come into their own.\nRP-wise aircraft pilots are still how’d you imagine a modern-day fighter pilot, though tempered by the knowledge that they’re basically the meat in a munitions sandwich. They crack wise and are often laid-back, as there’s little to do when a planet isn’t under attack - how one reacts to being forced out of this surety could be something to explore. While it\u0026rsquo;s possible for a player to play a “fat” bird like a cargo plane or gunship, it’s unlikely. Talk to your GM.\nGameplay-wise, Aircraft pilots are kings and queens of Nerves. They live and die by the stat, using their unmatched atmospheric maneuverability to dust aerospace fighters, dodge missiles and deflect lasers. There are devices that allow insertion of aircraft into atmosphere from space and even recovery, though during transit you’re basically a sitting duck.\nNote: VTOL fall roughly into this category and a bit into drivers - not very fleshed out.\nHelicopter Pilots # VTOL Pilots # Boat drivers # Navy fuckers.\nInfantry # You’re meat before the grinder, men and women clad in paper armour and with small arms standing before armour and giants. But since the first human picked up a rock to kill another, there’s been that other hardass that could still kill them barehanded. The pilots trust in their steel, but you, you have to trust in your skill and each other.\nThe infantry player is actually one of the more complex roles in M.A.S.O., as they must be, by design, in command of a squad. This complicates the role-playing aspect - how much detail do you go into about the squad? How large is it? How focused are you on the infantry commander vs the rest of the squad?\nGameplay-wise Infantry players are indispensable to M.A.S.O. operations because fundamentally they can go places others can’t go and do things that pilots can’t do. They can explore ruins or collapsed buildings or rescue civilians or root out opposition that holds a command centre. Everything above is the hammer. You are the nail.\nNon-Combat Characters # You might not want to play a combat character or want to take a break from combat from time to time, and that’s perfectly fair. Non-combat characters are welcome and are designed to fill gaps in the RP or gameplay experience that will naturally come about from having a bunch of violence-oriented individuals played in an RPG. You are welcome to talk with your GM to develop a character that fills a niche on the crew that the above classes overlook. A dedicated diplomat for smoothing jobs over, for example, or a communications expert to run ELINT or perhaps drones.\nBe warned though, these people are still in a military - they will come under fire eventually. It is on you how they respond to that.\nRP-wise, the floor is open. The breadth of non-combat characters is impossible to summarize - talk to your GM if you’re having trouble nailing one down - they probably have a niche in mind that would be good to fill or angle towards.\nGameplay-wise, you will be defined by your traits more than any other player. Make them characterful, make them useful and manipulate situations to allow you to use them as often as possible. s\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/rules/combat/attacks/","title":"Attacks","section":"Combat Rules","content":"Attacks are a Nerves check on 3d6 against a target 15 with any relevant modifiers. This includes the player’s modifiers and the target’s, of which there can be many, and is where the complexity in M.A.S.O really comes from. Aside from weapon modifiers, here are some common ones\nSize Differences # Targets gain size penalties and bonuses based on size differences. For every size category that a target is larger than the player, the player gets a +1 bonus against. For every size category that a target is smaller than the player, the player gets a -1 bonus against.\nSpeed # An infantry unit that has traded a major action for move actions gains +1 to be hit. This stacks, as when pushing yourself.\nFor every 50kph a vehicle has moved in its previous turn, it gains a +1 to be hit.

Light cover is penetrable by equivalent-scale weapons and the target is easily visible in it. It does not grant cover against larger-scale weapons.\nHeavy Cover grants -3 to be hit. Heavy cover is not penetrable by equivalent-scale weapons and the target is difficult to see in it. Larger-scale weapons reduce the penalty by -1.\nFull Cover does not allow equivalent-scale weapons to hit and the target is not visible. Larger scale weapons may attempt to hit the target with a -5 penalty.\nCalled Shots # Scaled weapnry # Being hit with weaponry of a different scale is devastating.

Infantry armour blocks damage. So when a shot connects, it does its damage first to the armour and then to the wearer’s hit points. Hit points are defined your Body stat - namely 5 x your Body (minimum of 10). Once a player’s hit points are depleted, they take an injury and their hit points reset. They are also not necessarily a 1-for-1 depiction of damage. If a bullet hits you and 2 damage goes through, you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have a bullet hole in you - bullet impacts through armor fucking hurt!\nBy default, characters have 2 injury \u0026ldquo;slots.\u0026rdquo;\nThe nature of the injury may penalize the reset hit points. Once a player has suffered their maximum amount of injuries, they are considered downed, not necessarily dead.\nHowever, further damage will rapidly hasten the onset of death.\nDefying death # When downed, a character has two options: staying down or trying to defy death.

If morale ever hits 0 a Zero Morale Event happens. This is bad. Avoid this. Morale lower than 5 is considered Low. If morale ever goes over 15, certain effects become more\u0026hellip; exciting.

Certain players may get insight into the relative morale of the unit, allowing them to know if morale is High, Low or Neutral.\nMorale can be spent to resist injuries, increase skill rolls in combat or otherwise high stakes encounters. A card game does not count - negotiating for a camp\u0026rsquo;s surrender does. 1 point of morale can be spent per-roll, unless otherwise specified. Note that because players never know the exact morale, they should be careful when spending points - but holding on to them puts you into the volatile High Morale status, which might not be great for some players’ mental health.\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/rules/","title":"Rules","section":"MASO - Mixed Arms Space Opera","content":" All rules to be considered in alpha stage.
