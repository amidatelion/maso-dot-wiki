	"content": "Stats There are only three stats in M.A.S.O - Body, Nerves, and Wit. The baseline of all of these is zero, with each point granting a bonus on rolls associated with it. These are fairly self explanatory and but a cursory explanation follows:\nBody: Represents feats of strength and endurance.\nNerves: Represents feats of precision and reflexes.\nWit: Represents feats of mental and interpersonal nature.\nTraits Traits are where the character modifications come from in M.A.S.O. You’ll note that Body, Nerves and Wit are pretty limited in what they describe. They will also be numerically limited. Traits are characteristics that grant situational modifiers that better describe what a character’s capabilities are. There are positive traits, trade-off traits and negative traits. A positive trait grants +1 to rolls on subjects mentioned in the trait. A trade-off grants +1 to some rolls and -1 to others. A negative trait grants -1 to rolls on subjects mentioned in the trait. Trade-off traits are generally only granted on character creation or by the GM for situations and behaviours as they see fit.\nOn character generation, a player gets 1 positive trait, and a trade-off trait. They may also “purchase” more positive traits by also taking negative ones. This is capped at 3 for character generation but otherwise, no cap exists.\nTraits should be characterful and represent a character’s experience - they can describe any situation, inside or outside of combat. See the sample characters for ideas.\nInjuries A player has 2 injuries available to them to start. These are only used in combat and are mitigated by hit points. Even if you get into a bar fight, you will not take an injury. I mean, unless you escalate the situation.\nGaining injuries is under development.\nHit Points Hit points are defined your Body stat - namely 10 x your Body (minimum of 10). Once a player’s hit points are depleted, they take an injury and their hit points reset.\n"

This means that out of combat situations force the players to think and present the GM with believable responses to situations, getting creative to overcome real challenges. In contested situations, the d20 does the legwork, with the d6 relegated to only doing damage and some limited table rolls - combat stuff.\nA roll is a success if it beats the target number. The target number is usually 15, with more mundane actions going as low as 10. Certain challenging situations will require rolls higher than 15. Ties count as failures.\n"

	"content": "Initiative isn’t rolled for or set like some games. It is seized, which means whoever wants to go next, can. On the first round of combat, someone seizes the “first” position. If two people want that position, one or the other can concede or they roll off. A seize roll is 1d20 + any modifiers. Ties result in another roll off. The process repeats until everyone has seized a place in the initiative order. If a player fails to seize the initiative, they take a cumulative -1 to all seize rolls, all of which can be removed by deferring to a lower initiative order as they back off and regroup.\nPlayers can remain in this initiative order for the remainder of combat, or they can defer or try to seize a higher initiative position each round. Deferring simply means dropping to a lower initiative position. Seizing a new position is a roll-off, with some extra steps. The seizing player rolls as normal and the “defending” player gets a bonus based on how many positions are between them and the seizing player.\n"

They also have three Ability Points. These can be split between stats and licenses. One Ability Point equals one stat point - these are straight upgrades and can be applied as seen fit.\nOn character generation, a player gets 1 positive trait, and a trade-off trait. They may also “purchase” more positive traits by also taking negative ones. This is capped at 3 for character generation but otherwise, no cap exists.\nDescriptors Write some easy descriptors for your character to get the point across real quick\nelaborate this section\nLicenses Licenses determine what vehicle can be driven or piloted. Everyone in M.A.S.O. starts with a Basic License. Congrats, you can drive a car, and therefore tanks, IFVs and all basic vehicles. Licenses sometimes have prerequisites, as seen on the tables below:\n   License Enables Requires     Basic Traditional land vehicles    VTOL VTOL aircraft Basic   Mech Basic mechs of any class Basic   Jump Jet Mech Jump Jet mechs of any class Mech, Basic   █████ Mech █████ Mechs Mech, Basic   Aircraft Jet, prop or other aircraft Basic   Spacecraft 8-DOF* spacecraft Basic   Aerospacecraft Trans-atmospheric craft Basic, Aircraft   EWS Electronic Warfare Attacks    Jump Packs Jump Infantry without checks    Drones Fine control of drones      * Eight degrees of freedom spacecraft - basically craft that can strafe and raise and lower relative altitude\nNote: On first glance this gives infantry a statistical advantage and dedicated tank/vehicle drivers especially. However, given the sheer firepower disadvantage they face, this is basically required. Even a tank driver might be blown free of a tank much more quickly than a mech pilot and so will have to rely on their Body, Nerves and Wit without mechanical aid more.\n"

	"title": "The Turn",
	"tags": null,
	"description": "",
	"content": "A turn is 1 move action, 1 major action, 1 minor action and free actions, taken in any order.\nMove Action A move action allows a player to move up to their speed in any valid direction. If they are in a vehicle, they move at the vehicle’s speed. Terrain or other effects may reduce this speed, but nothing may increase it. Instead, a player may push themselves or their vehicle.\nMajor Action A major action involves engaging in combat. Shooting, attacking in melee, throwing a grenade, any of these things are major actions. A vehicle may fire all of its weapons once as a major action - subsequent actions from pushing it allow it to fire 1 weapon 1 additional time. A Major action is worth 2 Minor or 2 Move actions - this is relevant to Pushing Yourself\nMinor Action A minor action is any active action that isn’t directly offensive. Reloading, deploying a drone, doing a scan, any of these are minor actions. See Pushing Yourself.\nFree Actions A free action is any action that is pure flavour, such as banter, posing, kissing a lucky charm, etc. They are time limited based on the GM or player’s judgement and you generally can only do 1 per round.\nPushing Yourself Any time a player wants to achieve more in a fight, they are welcome to push themselves. This grants them 1 further Major action. A Major action is worth 2 Minor or 2 Move actions. However, as infantry, they must roll on the Infantry consequences table to see if pushing themselves had any negative effects. As vehicles, they increment their heat by 1.\nInfantry Consequences On a roll of 2d6:    Roll Individual Result Squad result     2 Nothing… happens? Nothing… happens?   3 Ankle sprain Member slowed   4 Muscle tremors Ammo loss   5 Bone fracture Member Injured   6 Exhausted -1 Exhausted -1   7 Nothing… happens? Morale +1   8 Worsened Condition Gone Prone   9 Disoriented Member Injured!   10 Exhausted -2 Exhausted -2   11 Injury! Disobediance   12 Hyped +1 Morale +2     Nothing… happens?: You really need me to explain this to you? Consider this a warning. Ankle sprain: The individual’s movement speed is reduced by half. Member slowed: A member of the squad’s speed is reduced by half. The squad can either match their speed or leave the member behind. Muscle tremors: Overexertion has taken its toll on your body. Any Nerves rolls take a -1 penalty for the remainder of the fight. Ammo loss: In the hectic rush, all members lose 1 reload of their weapons. If a heavy weapon is present, on a roll of 4+ on a d6, it loses a reload as well. Bone Fracture: Now you’ve done it. You slammed into something or held a gun wrong and you’ve fractured a bone. Any Body rolls take a -1 penalty for the remainder of the fight. Member Injured!: Someone slipped and fell, giving themselves a concussion or some other piece of battlefield bad luck. They are out of the fight. Exhausted: You’ve really pushed yourself(ves) past your limits. Take the indicated penalty to all actions for 10 rounds, or 5 rounds without movement. This stacks and resets the count. Worsened Condition: Any penalties you have taken are incremented by 1. This does not affect time periods. If you have no penalties, nothing happens. Gone Prone: Someone slipped and feel, but this time everyone assumes they’ve been downed by something and go prone to avoid the same fate. The squad is rendered immobile, but gain Light Cover. Disoriented: The whiplash of your faster than normal acts have left you confused. The GM may control the direction of your movement or target of an attack for 1 round. Injury!: You immediately take an injury. Disobediance: You pushed the squad too hard and now they’re irascible. They may refuse to move, take different action than the one you intend, or worse. GM’s choice. This also damage’s the company’s Morale by -1. Hyped: Yo, did you see that move?! You’re running high on adrenaline. For the next 3 rounds you have a +1 to all rolls. This stacks and resets the round counter. Morale: You all are so good at your jobs, you feel like you can do anything. For the next 3 rounds you have the indicated bonus to all rolls. This stacks and resets the round counter. Additionally, whatever the highest Morale modifier the squad achieves is carried over to the company’s morale at the end of combat.\n"

	"content": "A player may move their speed in combat. On foot, their speed is fixed. In a vehicle, they have three speeds: combat, cruising, flat out, noted on the sheet. A combat speed is slowest, but allows for the best maneuverability and is always available. Cruising is meant for covering large distance and in order to enter cruising speed, a vehicle must have spent 1 round at combat speed as it takes time to accelerate. To move at cruising speed, a pilot must use 1 move action to move, and 1 more to move at cruising. A pilot making anything more than basic course adjustments must succeed on a Nerves check against a target of 10.\nFlat out works similarly, except that for every round the vehicle has spent in flat out, its heat increments by one. To move at flat out speed, a pilot must use 1 move action to move, and 2 more to move at flat out. Even basic maneuvering during flat out speeds requires a Nerves check against a target of 10 and making complex course corrections must be made against a target of 15.\nTerrain and the environment may impede movement. Difficult terrain halves speed and dangerous terrain causes effects listed or described by the GM.\nUnder Construction  Representing Speed is difficult. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the energy these days to properly do up nice maps and tokens, but ideally that\u0026rsquo;s how this would go. Beta release will likely tackle this in more detail.    "

	"content": "Drivers Drivers can vary from ferryfolk driving Infantry Fighting Vehicles to tank drivers. They are flexible in their job description and very aware that their rides can get blown out from under them in the blink of an eye. As such they’re among the most hard-bitten, devil-may-care characters. Think of the tank commander holding his shot under fire until a mech exposes a weak-spot or the IFV driver drifting her ride up against a building to provide safe cover for infantry loading up hostages.\nRole-playing wise a driver is likely to be a single individual, though some larger tanks may require a crew. It’s up to the player to sort out how they want to handle this with the GM and it’s recommended that they be able to see the Infantry player struggle with RPing a squad first or at least have some communal RP experience from commanding The Commander first.\nGameplay-wise these drivers tend towards min-maxing, if you can call it that. They are the most likely to be exposed to danger in the relatively flimsiest vehicles and so work themselves, their environment and the rules to the max to ensure their survival and that of their charges. Though there’s something to be said for being a generalist when your ride is constantly being blown out from underneath you.\nPilots Aircraft Pilots Once seekers of matchless glory, aircraft pilots have fallen a long way from their glamorous positions in the 20th century. No longer are they the hot shots, the kings and queens of the sky. Indeed, they have taken on a more pedestrian role of support and defenders. When the infantry need help, they are the ones most likely to be able to respond quickly. But real glory comes from defensive operations, when landbound targets are under fire. When the skies darken with drop pods and aerospace fighters, the aircraft pilots come into their own.\nRP-wise aircraft pilots are still how’d you imagine a modern-day fighter pilot, though tempered by the knowledge that they’re basically the meat in a munitions sandwich. They crack wise and are often laid-back, as there’s little to do when a planet isn’t under attack - how one reacts to being forced out of this surety could be something to explore. While it\u0026rsquo;s possible for a player to play a “fat” bird like a cargo plane or gunship, it’s unlikely. Talk to your GM.\nGameplay-wise, Aircraft pilots are kings and queens of Nerves. They live and die by the stat, using their unmatched atmospheric maneuverability to dust aerospace fighters, dodge missiles and deflect lasers. There are devices that allow insertion of aircraft into atmosphere from space and even recovery, though during transit you’re basically a sitting duck.\nNote: VTOL fall roughly into this category and a bit into drivers - not very fleshed out.\nSpacecraft Pilots It’s you and the black out here. Though all branches of all forces have pilot-recovery protocols and drill them rigorously, space is a very, very big place. It’s a sobering thought that one second, one wrong move, could condemn you to drifting in the black for the rest of your (short) life. Thankfully, spacecraft tend to be hardier than aircraft and have eight degrees of freedom to dodge in.\nRoleplaying-wise spacecraft pilots lack the traditions and history of their airbound brethren and so have had to form their own. A tradition that has tended towards insularity and being protective of one another - the sphere formation of the The Hauberi-Coronand War is a good example of this being put into action, or a bar fight suddenly turning into a 1-on-12.\nGameplay-wise spacecraft pilots work similarly to aircraft pilots, though in place of Nerves, they rely on Wit because their maneuvers can be mentally taxing - you try to keep track of your fighter, the enemy, free-whirling debris and frictionless movement in any direction in space.\nAerospace Pilots Here be the jocks, the speed demons, those that live on the edge. Less maneuverable in air and space than their counterparts, they’ve turned towards their one major advantage - Fuck. Huge. Engines. An aerospace fighter is approximately 70% engine with weapons tacked on as convenient and armour being an afterthought. But goddamn can they move.\nRP-wise, these are the elite. You need to be qualified in aircraft before you’re even allowed to train on aerospace craft. And because of the inherent disadvantage that those pilots suffer from vis-a-vis other craft, generally only the best of the best are chosen. They are also rare, as the mortality rate of these lightly armoured pilots is unfortunately high. There is something fae to these pilots, and something dangerous.\nGameplay-wise, you’re barely going to be on the board. The absurd power of the crafts’ engines, designed to get them back into orbit after a mission means that what they lack in immediate maneuverability they make up for hard attack angles and board-spanning reach. As they are exceptionally reliant on their gear, Wit matters, but Body won’t go amiss either. What’s 6Gs? Breakfast, scrub.\nNote: it is entirely possible that instead of an aerospace fighter you might be a dropship or gunship pilot. Talk to the GM about those possibilities.\nWalkers Yeah, I know what you’re here for. The new ground-pounders, the Walkers-in-Steel. To pilot a Mech is to hook into a VR-infosphere that makes you feel like a giant on the battlefield. Overconfidence is your wont as you mount more armour than a tank and more weapons besides while being the biggest target on the ground. But ask any mech pilot, they wouldn’t give it up for the world - they are the gods of war in the Star Era. They know it, the public knows it and they are often at the forefront of the media.\nRP-wise, as much as bravado is part-and-parcel of a being a mech pilot, it is drilled into them that they are entrusted with the firepower of at least a platoon up to an entire tank battalion, to be dispensed from their fingertips. The young tend to be cocky and tactically interested, the old reserved and wise, easing well into strategic roles. Through their experience on the battlefield and their wealth of sensor knowledge, they are often second-in-command on the ground if no better option exists.\nGameplay-wise, your experience will differ from light to medium to heavy mechs. You could switch from being a scout to a trooper to a battlefield monster, but a few things remain the same. Movement is life, weapons are hot and getting surrounded gets you killed. You are the hammer, but without your fellows on the battlefield, you will be taken down. With prejudice.\nInfantry You’re meat before the grinder, men and women clad in paper armour and with small arms standing before armour and giants. But since the first human picked up a rock to kill another, there’s been that other hardass that could still kill them barehanded. The pilots trust in their steel, but you, you have to trust in your skill and each other.\nThe infantry player is actually one of the more complex roles in M.A.S.O., as they must be, by design, in command of a squad. This complicates the role-playing aspect - how much detail do you go into about the squad? How large is it? How focused are you on the infantry commander vs the rest of the squad?\nGameplay-wise Infantry players are indispensable to M.A.S.O. operations because fundamentally they can go places others can’t go and do things that pilots can’t do. They can explore ruins or collapsed buildings or rescue civilians or root out opposition that holds a command centre. Everything above is the hammer. You are the nail.\nNon-Combat Characters You might not want to play a combat character or want to take a break from combat from time to time, and that’s perfectly fair. Non-combat characters are welcome and are designed to fill gaps in the RP or gameplay experience that will naturally come about from having a bunch of violence-oriented individuals played in an RPG. You are welcome to talk with your GM to develop a character that fills a niche on the crew that the above classes overlook. A dedicated diplomat for smoothing jobs over, for example, or a communications expert to run ELINT or perhaps drones.\nBe warned though, these people are still in a military - they will come under fire eventually. It is on you how they respond to that.\nRP-wise, the floor is open. The breadth of non-combat characters is impossible to summarize - talk to your GM if you’re having trouble nailing one down - they probably have a niche in mind that would be good to fill or angle towards.\nGameplay-wise, you will be defined by your traits more than any other player. Make them characterful, make them useful and manipulate situations to allow you to use them as often as possible.\nSecondary Characters Now, it might be that everyone wants to play combat characters and the party is really feeling the need for some RP opportunities that would be better served by a non-combat character. Or perhaps they’re made available at the opening of the campaign or for a particular subsection. Either way, if you’re playing an NCC as a secondary character, it should be one of two ways: One Each: You get a secondary character and you get a secondary character and you get a- \u0026hellip; Yeah. Functionally, no one should be left out of this opportunity - it\u0026rsquo;s not fun when one person or a subset of people get extra RP opportunities.  Commander Model: The secondary character is shared among the group like The Commander, as per below.  The Commander One of M.A.S.O.’s conceits is the figure of The Commander - a shared NPC that all the players control and have input on. The Commander is the one giving the orders and is the primary story driver. That’s not to say individual player characters aren’t important - but they’re important on the tactical or day-to-day level, which informs the higher storytelling or week-to-week level.\nThe Commander is played by the GM and the players in committee. To do so they enter the Commander’s Headspace. The GM will often kick this off with a premise or problem the Commander is mulling over, like where to go next. But, and this is important, players should feel that they can call for Headspace time. In Headspace, the given situation is discussed and a decision is come to by the player with the input of the GM. Two things to note here:\n The Headspace issue must end with a decision, policy or act for the Commander to\u0026hellip; action. The GM has input but should not drive the discussion. They are the repository of The Commander’s personality and knowledge but should not use this to constantly override player decisions, simply to steer them. Only if a group cannot agree on an action can the GM decide the matter, choosing the least offensive option and thereby pissing everyone off. Them’s the breaks.\nUnder Construction  The role of the commander is under consideration.      "

	"description": "so. many. tables.",
	"content": "Damage can broadly be split into Infantry and Vehicle Damage models.\nInfantry Damage Damage against a person or beast or really anything organic is done against their HP and usually mitigated by armour. Infantry armour blocks damage. So when a shot connects, it does its damage first to the armour and then to the wearer’s hit points. Hit points are defined your Body stat - namely 10 x your Body (minimum of 10). Once a player’s hit points are depleted, they take an injury and their hit points reset. The nature of the injury may penalize the reset hit points. Once a player has suffered their maximum amount of injuries, they are considered out of the fight, not necessarily dead. By default, characters have 2 injuries. However, further damage will rapidly hasten the onset of death.\nVehicle Damage Damage against a vehicle is done against their armour and then their structure. Additionally, in this model, damage is measured per hit location, as defined on a character sheet. All of a location’s armour must be depleted before any damage can be done to structure. Different weapons will perform better against structure or armour and different locations will have different armour values depending on their purpose. One a location has lost all its structure points, it becomes destroyed. This may disable the vehicle. Certain weapons may even temporarily disable the location by dealing any amount damage to the structure. When certain locations are damaged, they may make the vehicle as a whole count as destroyed. See the table below.    Vehicle Parts     Tanks, ground vehicles, etc Chassis   Mechs Center Torso, Head   Aircraft, aerospacecraft Yes   Spacecraft Yes*     Targeting Shots may be targeted against vehicles, depending on a character’s Nerves stat.

Damage to a vehicle’s motive device(s) (whether that be tracks, wheels or hover curtain) will reduce its mobility by a certain amount depending on the vehicle.\nA mech will generally not suffer reduced mobility on damage to its legs, except for highly specialized weapons. Losing a leg however will reduce it to combat speed only, and even then it will move at half its maximum combat speed. Losing both causes the mech to topple and become immobile, though its upper body functions will continue to work.\n*A note about spacecraft: unlike other flying craft, it is possible for a player to continue fighting when a part is destroyed - you’re not going to crash into a ground of some kind. However, given the nature of space combat and the extreme risks involved, it\u0026rsquo;s usually best to register as a non-combatant.\n"

	"description": "Return of the tables.",
	"content": " Under Construction  Subject to massive revision. Not really happy with how it slows down combat.    Heat is a characteristic of vehicles that defines how often they are able to fire in a given round. They have a latent heat, heat generation, heat sinking and a heat limit. Latent heat is the baseline level of heat that the mech is currently possessed of. A vehicle may fire all of its weapons as a major action or move its speed without generating Heat.\nHeat generation is the total number of Pushes a vehicle has gone through. Heat sinking is the level of cooling that a mech has, from its weapons and heat sinks. Heat limit is the level of heat that a mech can be possessed of before suffering overheat. Overheat causes effects that can include structural damage, ammo cookoffs and weapon disabilities.\nIf a vehicle’s heat level is higher than its maximum heat at the end of the round, it overheats. This may seem complicated, so have an example:    Latent Heat Heat Generation Heat Sinking Heat at end of round Heat limit Result     Mik’s status is normal Mik Fires 4 weapons His heat sinks sink 3 heat  His mech’s heat max No overheat   0 +4 -3 1 2     Plus Subtract Equals Compared to Carry     The above is a best-case scenario. However, you’ll find these scenarios to be few and far in between, particularly as players face escalating, ever greater challenges in the process of their mission.\nBelow, you’ll find a more common situation.    Latent Heat Heat Generation Heat Sinking Heat at end of round Heat limit Result     Mik had 1 heat left over from the end of the round, upgraded 2 actions, and was hit by a flamer Mik Fires 4 weapons His heat sinks sink 3 heat  His mech’s heat max Overheat at +1   2 +4 -3 3 2 +1    Plus Subtract Equals Compared to      Obviously, you don’t need to fire all, or even any weapons. This is your primary means of de-escalating your heat.\nAnother thing to note: The overheat value is the difference between a vehicle’s heat limit and the total heat and adds to the roll on the overheat table:\nHeat Consequences On a roll of 2d6    Roll Result     2 Heat Cascade +1   3 Nothing… happens?   4 Heat Bloom -1   5 Heat Cascade +2, Component Damage   6 Nothing… happens?   7 Emergency Shutdown!   8 Heat Bloom -2, Structure Damage   9 Injury!   10 Emergency Shutdown!   11 Massive Structure Damage   12 Ammo Cookoff!   13 Emergency Shutdown! Ammo Cookoff -1!   14 Injury x2!   15+ Emergency Shutdown! Ammo Cookoff -2!     Heat Cascade: The building heat is too much for your heat stinks to deal with and they begin to fail. Increase latent heat by indicated amount.\nNothing… happens?: You really need me to explain this to you? Consider this a warning.\nHeat Bloom: Sweat drips, vision wavers. Due to the rising temperatures in the cockpit, all piloting actions suffer the indicated amount until latent heat reaches zero. This does not stack.\nComponent Damage: A part of the vehicle suffers damage. GMs choice, and it’s likely to have been one involved in the overheat.\nStructure Damage: Wires melt, hydraulics seize and lubricant combusts. Direct damage to the vehicle’s structure occurs to a location of the GM’s choice. Likely to be have been involved in the overheat.\nAmmo Cookoff!: Now you’re in it. On a d6 roll of a 5+ your ammunition reserves detonate, dealing max damage to the vehicle\u0026rsquo;s central structure. The target number is reduced by the indicated amount.\nInjury!: The heat has become so severe the exposed surfaces of your cockpit are dangerous to touch. You are losing water at a terrifying rate. All crew immediately take an injury.\nEmergency Shutdown!: The vehicle’s safeties kick in and turn the vehicle off for a round. A ground vehicle in motion moves in the direction it was moving at half speed. A mech in motion immediately topples and goes immobile. A stationary mech merely goes immobile.\nMassive Structure Damage: Like structure damage except worse in every way.\n"

	"content": "Unit Morale is invisibly tracked on a scale from 0 to 20. That is, the GM tracks it and it is invisible to the players.\nMorale starts at the beginning of a campaign at a level determined by the GM and can be increased by player actions and decreased by enemy actions (or, with really bad roles/plans, player actions). If morale ever hits 0 a zero morale event happens. This is bad. Avoid this. Morale lower than 5 is considered Low. If morale ever goes over 15, certain effects become more\u0026hellip; exciting. However, because they\u0026rsquo;re riding high, players may suffer interesting side effects when they lose morale as reality vibe checks them. Certain players may get insight into the relative morale of the unit, allowing them to know if morale is High, Low or Neutral.\nMorale can be spent to resist injuries, increase skill rolls in combat or otherwise high stakes encounters. A card game does not count - negotiating for a SecCorp cruiser\u0026rsquo;s surrender does. 1 point of morale can be spent per-roll, unless otherwise specified. Note that because players never know the exact morale, they should be careful when spending points - but holding on to them puts you into the volatile High Morale status, which might not be great for some players’ mental health.\n"

Corvids live and work alongside humans, and the alien Slithiri allied with us out of concern for us. Humanity, fractious as it is, exists in a (poorly) balanced state of existence. We\u0026rsquo;ve learned how to punch wormholes through space and sail through and colossal Planetary Scale Terraformers slowly shape colony planets into things we can live on. But it\u0026rsquo;s a cold galaxy.\nAnd there are wolves. "
