The story of MASO is the story of The Human Sphere, a nascent multi-species interstellar nation. Yes, multi-species. Corvids live and work alongside humans, and the alien Slithiri allied with us out of concern for us. Humanity, fractious as it is, exists in a (poorly) balanced state of existence. We've learned how to punch wormholes through space and sail through and colossal Planetary Scale Terraformers slowly shape colony planets into things we can live on. But it's a cold galaxy.
