Your name is Ram Saetang, Captain in the Colonial Defense Forces of the Human Sphere and you’ve just come out of the longest meeting of your life. You, the regional Director of the Colonial Bureau, a marshal of the CDF, a rear admiral of Sol System Defense and a half dozen other bureau and corp suits you couldn’t be bothered to remember. You figured this was going to be a two to four hour affair where you’d make your case, questions would be asked and then the brass would adjourn to deliberate and you’d eventually get approved or shot down.  

Your first clue that something was wrong was when the booking came for 6 am, an hour before even the military gets to work and three before the corporates usually did. Fourteen hours of arguing, counter-proposals, negotiations, clarifications, snippet briefings and politicking followed. You’d learned more about how the CDF interacted with the Bureau and SSF in the past day than in a decade of service.  

Badly, it turned out.  

Rear Admiral Johnston was convinced and continued through the meeting to push the idea that the uptick in piracy and loss of life on the rim was due to CDF incompetence and perhaps active malice. The idea of giving a CDF captain a task force for long-term anti-piracy work was, in his opinion, bound to compound the problem.

You really wanted to punch Johnston by the end of the day. Actually, besides some of the corporates, you’re pretty sure everyone in the room wanted to punch Johnston.  

Director Chan had concerns, largely around the feasibility of such a long-term deployment. While fabrikators solved most mechanical upkeep problems, human upkeep was a separate issue. Requisitioning supplies from colonies was part and parcel of the CDF’s mandate when necessary but tended to cause friction with those colonies. Your proposed patrol route and schedule accounted for that, of course, checking in at CDF stations and intersecting patrol routes frequently enough to alleviate the need for colonial requisitions. To further offset the potential of turning colonies “stray” or “feral,” you’d also included Kamon’s plans for medical and resource outreach. They’d certainly had an effect on the Bureau suits; you’d have to send her your thanks. 

Johnston had made positive-sounding noises at the medical outreach and then, to no one’s surprise, lamented the material side of it as “blatant profiteering by the CDF.” 

Probably the only thing even approaching that irritation was Marshal Ayim’s constant clarification for Johnston. Oh, you understood where it was coming from: making it abundantly clear to everyone present that Johnston was uninformed and an idiot. But that handily added at least two or three hours of briefings into the mess. It probably also made it clear to Johnston that the CDF, at this juncture, just didn’t have the resources to properly police the Rim.  

Which, of course, made the negotiating phase of all this hellish. There was no way the small patrol fleet you’d outlined was getting approved. But you were surprised by the pressure that Chan and Ayim applied to Johnston, the careful, strangely in-sync ways they deflected or used his “objections” against each other. Which was good, because by that point you were totally not prepared to argue for the exact assets that you’d need. You didn’t even know you’d be arguing for that today!  

You made it back to your quarters and grabbed a bia hoi from the fridge, collapsing into the couch you’d traded a departing infantry lieutenant for. This was the longest you’d been station-side since leaving Earth. By a long shot. Reconstructive eye surgery would do that to you though. Just the thought of it made you wince and take a long pull from the shitty beer. 

After fourteen hours, not only was the meeting done but you were now a captain in earnest: one with a ship under your command. Which ship? Who knows. Crewed by who? Ditto. You’d been granted the “whole resources of Perimeter Station” to equip that one ship, to go out on a solo patrol, to root out and right the wrongs of this furthest edge of the Human Sphere. 

If only Master Saelim could see you now. If only Kamon could.  

A memory flitted through your mind then - the three of you in his hangar back on Earth. Dark lines of mechs glinting silently in the post-nuclear sunset behind you, the cries of recovering fauna before you. At the feet of the tallest you all argue good naturedly, drinking bia hoi slightly better than this.  

A stabbing pain from your implants shakes you out of it and you pound the remaining beer. Then you grab a tablet and another beer besides. Real work should probably wait until tomorrow, but there’s no reason you can’t do some preliminary searching now. There’s always lower deck crew available in some respect - if not, it’s like a 2 week course for most spacers and while the CDF doesn’t have much going for it, the appeal of a Bureau pension is appealing for most folk out here.  

Specialized crew will be the problem. As a full fledged captain you should be able to requisition skeleton crew of rank-and-file, but the quirks of the CDF means that accessing real, honest-to-gods talent will require actual requirement - pitches to those individuals, convincing them that your ticket is the one they want to sign for, that it’s worth signing for. 

You access the personnel DB and start searching.

Your name is Ram Saetang, Danny to your friends, Redeye in the cockpit and now Captain of the first Recon-In-Force patrol group. You get to work.
