“In 2297, your corporation reported record losses, laying off the majority of your employees. While gains have been reported intermittently over the past twenty years, at no point do your records indicate a shift into IP territory. And yet now you appear with documented claims on IPs  in detail, indicating a level of awareness of the industry that belies your corporation’s inexperience in this sector. 

“Simultaneously, in 2297, Aebracomm was founded, an IP speculation company. Bursting onto the scene with silent backer money, Aebracomm was able to quickly disrupt the industry and set the standard for IP speculation that’s lasted almost until this day. Until your corporation bought them out with an as-yet undisclosed source of funds.”

She’d entered the boardroom like a dagger, her suit tailored to emphasize angles where humans shouldn’t have any. Her makeup was perfect in its inhumanity, giving her a pale lustre that no amount of red on her lips could have saved. So instead they gleamed an osteoid pink with a faint sheen and subtle glitter. 

The Bureau representative sat back and pushed her glasses back onto her nose, swiping through her tablet for more information on this supposed diplomat. “A great talking head, good at putting the squeeze on corps” her boss had said. Yeah, right. She was putting the squeeze on them alright. Like calling a chokeslam foreplay.  

A disquieted cough.

“Those are… impressive allegations Miss-”

“Cut the shit.”
“Cut the shit.”

It comes out twice, just slightly out of sync, the woman’s voice and a corvid’s natural caw. Enormous wings burst from behind her chair and a positively ancient raven flaps its way onto her shoulder.  If her small form had cut an imposing figure before, now it holds weight and a sense that some nameless doom had settled on the meeting.

The Bureau suit forces herself to swallow.  

-- 50 minutes ago --

“Lazy sack of shit! Lazy sack of shit! Wake up! Wake up!”

She hurls her pillow at the old raven in a familiar ritual and sits up blearily. Different quarters, same cramped feeling. Why on earth had she ever decided to come out to the Rim? The Raven flutters over to the small kitchenette and pecks away at a coffee machine. The human blinks blearily into what passes as morning, which is to say a solar lamp simulating dawn. 

It’s 10:30am.  

To an outside observer, it might look like she stares blankly at her sheets, but in reality a not-inconsiderable biocomputer is booting up in her brain. She’s recalling her assignment for today, regretting staying up way too late last night obliterating casuals’ records in every game the station offers and wondering if she has time for a shower, or even breakfast that isn’t a smoothie or gruel.

Given that the raven is already pecking at the gruel dispenser, she suspects the answer is “Nope.”

Grabbing AR glasses, she blinks her way through menus as she begins to wake up, sipping at the incredibly, incredibly shitty coffee this station has. Like, seriously, why the fuck was she out here. This is terrible. Squinting, she brings up docs, scans them, briefs herself on the assignment the Bureau has set for her. 

It has been 7 minutes since she woke up. The raven looks at her, head cocked inquisitively. 

“No, I don’t think I need help on this.” She blinks through a few more menus and searches, then takes off the glasses and lets them compile the notes she expects. Time for a shower. The hot water is a luxury out here that she is extremely interested in making the most of, right up until the raven pokes his beak into the shower and rams the temperature downwards.  

Somewhere in the shrieking, cursing outburst she fully wakes up into her wrath. 

Dressing quickly and hurling knicknacks at the raven, she has the glasses vocalize its findings. She asks questions about data, kicks off more searches and plops herself before a basic makeup station.

It has been 17 minutes since she woke up. 

Foundation, history, powder, data, blush, blackmail, mascara, appendices, gloss, character studies, dustings and internet feeds are applied like warpaint to her. Her silence gives way to murmurs, repeating salient facts, muttering anecdotes, psyching herself up. As she draws the last line from her eyebrows out, she ends the ritual,

“The blade of my mind is forged, the dagger of my face is ready. I’m a bitch and a weapon and a bitch of a weapon and may what gods exist have mercy on my enemies.”

It has been 37 minutes since she woke up.

There’s time to grab a shitty croissant from a cafe on her way to the corp board room.

-- 3 years ago --

They kicked her out. Her own fucking pro gaming team that she picked up and dragged through Regionals and Globals and then managed through Galactics and-

She pounds the soju back like the vet she is. Twenty-four and “too old” to be the face of a corporate comp team. Too few smiles and peace signs, too many victories and broken enemies.

Fuck the sword of their skill, fuck the dagger of her research. Fuck them. 

“Aww, poor Sha-sha,” the digital voice cuts through her eare via her translator like a knife. She knows he can talk better than most corvids, so this is really insulting, relying on the translator. “All washed up before her twenty-fifth, just like daddy said.”

“Diu ne lo mo,” she mutters in his general direction, without enough venom or passion . 

“She’s dead, you dick, just like yours.”

Her hand convulses around the soju glass, but she doesn’t dignify his shit with a reaction, just pouring herself another. 

“Oh, that’s how its gonna be. Just gonna drink yourself into a stupor and not stand up for yourself. That’s fine, fucking anyone could probably manage this labour dispute anyways. Better than the colonial government anyways.”

She snorts. “Not hard. The colonists aren’t even asking for much.Tie the education they’re asking for to the skills the colony needs. Mechanical engineering, geology, whatever. Give ‘em the education for ecks amount of debt or ecks amount of years working for the colony. Worst case you get skilled labor for ecks years. Best case, you get a better educated, committed-to-their homes working class.

“GOD,” she says gulping down another glass. “It isn’t HARD.”

A man in a grey suit slightly down the bar is looking at her strangely. “The fuck you want?”

“Um. Sorry. Do you, uh. Do you think it’d be that easy?”   

“In theory? Fuck yeah. In practice? Ehn. Needs tweaking. Throw a marketing team at it, buff the rough edges out. Don’t screw the populace, that’s how you get insurrections. But like. This is a solved problem. Has been for centuries. Just fucking invest in your populace. 2 million in 2 years is better than the 200 a head you’re saving now. Play the long game, not the short like a chump.”

“Right. Makes sense. Sorry, I’m Director Abidi. I didn’t catch your name or department…?”

“Uh? I just got fired from the Hengdian Shockwave. I’m not, like, a suit or anything.”

“...Ma’am in the past 2 minutes you’ve given me better…”

-- Now --

“-and you can expect to be back in business in the Rim within three years at a nominal loss.”

“Two hundred and seventy billion is not a nominal loss.”

“It is when you’re staring down the double barrels of ‘Celestial Court fraud case’ and ‘mass investor migration’ with an underslung launcher of ‘civil litigation.’ “

The smile she gives them is anything but sweet. The raven makes a curious noise that the humans in the room quickly identify as the sound of a shotgun racking a shell.  

--

“Holy shit,” the Bureau suit finally mutters, looking at the paperwork in front of her, absolving the Colonial Bureau of any fault with regards to the intellectual property used in their tourism, recruitment and otherwise advertisement videos.  The small woman is getting up, the raven taking flight and already leaving the room. She gets to her feet quickly and says,

“Ah- sorry! We haven’t been introduced, I’m Wengchian Wo. I knew the Bureau had contracted an independent operator for these negotiations, but… wow. That was something else.”

The small woman gives a smile that’s much friendlier than the one aimed at the corp suits.

“Xialin Liu. And-” she’s interrupted by cawing about lunch. “-Nicklenock. He gets peckish in his old age. It was a pleasure working with you, Miss Wo.”

In a dizzying act of diplomatic chaff, she bows in a half curtsy over Wengchian’s hand and flees the room, leaving the career bureaucrat staring at her hand with a vague sense of stardust and glitter.
