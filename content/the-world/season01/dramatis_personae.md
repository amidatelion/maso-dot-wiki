# Human Sphere
## First Recon-In-Force
The Player Characters

### Commodore Ram "Danny" Saetang
The erstwhile protagonist of this cycle. The last student of General Reginald Saelim, a decorated war hero, fearless commander and current pilot of *The Blackmech*. God rest his soul.

### Aleksandr "Sasha" Sokolov
A great bear of a Romanian, with a distinctly russo-boo cant to him, Sasha is currently First Recon's brawler, tank and frontline morale generator. His mech was the Shin Shoryuken, which was destroyed in battle with Deckard True. Following that fight, he salvaged True's mech for his own.

### Lieutenant Commander Aryana Latfi
Aryana Latfi is a recent defector from SecCorp, where she was bred and raised to be an aerospace pilot. Between that and SecCorp's increasingly cavalier treatment of human life, she sought out CDF personnel, transferred classified information and took her squad with her. She flies a Screamwing aerospace fighter.

### Commander Alec Reid
First Recon's infantry commander, Alec Reid is your stereotypical Scotsman. Large, brash, and generous to a fault, he leads from the front, frequently driving the squad's APC. He is also a Bearer of the Secrets of Uisge Beath, a nigh-holy charge set him by his people.

### Boden Andersen
A non-descript midwesterner, Boden is First Recon's dropship pilot. Easy-going and accomidating, Boden fits in well just about anywhere. He's not a friend that stands out, but definitely one that can be counted on.  Almost always found within sight of his Sister, Britta Andersen.

### Britta Andersen
Shorter and wider than her brother, Britta andersen has a pugilist's physique, sharing Boden's hair, but less of his congeniality. Undergoing therapy and psychiatric care following dangerous reactions to neurohelms, she fights as a frontline lancer in her experimental Mannequin mech.

### Commander Catherine Elizabeth du Maurier
First Recon's medical officer, duMaurier is a specialist in emergency relief and refugee situations. Her career has kept her away from the Core, where she apparently has family. While she won't be winning any TacOps competitions, she is a capable battlefield commander and not a bad shot with a pistol.

### Lieutenant Otto Fuchs
A lackadasical but highly effective communications and sensor officer. Wary of rank and commendations, Fuchs very much does not want to be in the thick of things. Unfortunately, his big mouth and obvious talents continue to see him succeed. Has a rivalry with So.

### Sonorously Sings at Sunset
Nicknamed So, this raven was doing time after hacking orbital satellites for fun before getting picked up by Danny. So is now a field operative, providing E-War capabilities to First Recon from within the relative safety of his Fjalar experimental stealth craft. Has a rivalry with Fuchs.

### Xialin Liu
A former competitive gamer, Xialin's talents at manipulating people were picked up by the Bureau wholly by accident. Having been fired from her team, she joined the Bureau as a diplomatic liaison and quickly got to work cutting deals and making enemies. She has some manner of lifebond with the raven Nicklenock.

### Nicklenock
A huge, bad tempered raven that serves almost as Xialin's familiar. Has a better-than-average facility with spoken languages and mimicry. An asshole.



## Colonials
People aligned to the Colonial Bureau and Colonial Defense forces

### Director Hao Chan
Current Director of the Colonial Bureau and technically commander-in-chief of the CDF. As there is currently only one Marshal, he lets Marshal Ayim run it with regular reports. Skilled politician and paper-pusher. Supported the formation of Recon-in-Force from a neutral position.

# Aliens
## The Wandering Remnant
There are approximately a dozen recorded meetings of the Wandering Remnant. They appear to want to trade ephemeral things for some manner of preservatory goal. Their colossal ships seem to move between planes of reality in a way distantly related to wormholes. No one has ever seen an individual, all communication has been radio/audio only.
## The Hauberi-Coronand
The second alien race encountered by humanity. Experienced a society-wide case of existential dysmetropsia that caused them to attack humanity. Wiped out in questionable act of self-defense.
## The Eater of Worlds
Responsible for consuming Bergamina, CPL-1142, and Variety. And a whole lot of alien cultures if you believe the Wandering Remnant.

## The Perfect Empire
Massive, sprawling multi-species empire
### Captain Krulrik
Cocksure patrol captain who tried to advance his career by engaging with humans. Didn’t go well for him. Ate a fist full of Blackmech.
### Conductress Kdiza
Junior Conductress assigned to Krulrik. In over her head.
### His Imperial Majesty Kostakiin II
Emperor of the, uh, Perfect Empire. Kind of a big deal. Favours the Conductress Assembly.
### Conductress Dominant Yreza
High-ranking Conductress. Scheming. Appears to know about something called a “Machine Heresy.”

# Mechs of Note
## The Blackmech
What is the Blackmech? Is it the form of it, its structure? Because it has never had a consistent one, modified by its pilots' whims and needs, or as its tech-cult interprets *its* desires. No, the Blackmech is more than anything the adaptive, almost invasive intelligence residing in dedicate banks and processors. That's what people fear, not the blackened armor, not the booming weapons. They fear the thing that takes a human pilot and makes of them a meat puppet designed for *violence*.

## Melior
The Melior is Deckard True's personal mech. Weighing in at seventy tons and faster than most things that are twenty tons lighter, the Melior is every bit of advanced tech the pirates could get their hands on, mated to a primitive but highly effective fission reactor. Enormous cannons destroy smaller mechs outright, while vicious mechanical scissors dismember others for salvage. With stolen Mitsui tech, its aerial maneuverability is virtually unmatched.

## Yang Xiao Long
Named for a fictional hero from the family's past, the *Yang Xiao Long* is a hyper-advanced light mech capable of dishing out damage equal to a medium. Converting heat in novel ways to melt most armor types, along with new myomers that operate better under thermal load, the *Yang Xiao Long* hits hard in Trisha Oum's hands. She has yet to do a proper deep-dive on it and find all the "gifts" her mother left her in it.
