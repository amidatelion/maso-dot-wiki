You are Commander Catherine Elizabeth duMaurier, it is six in the morning and you just can’t drink like you used to. Oh, you’re not hungover, but you are having trouble piecing together why the Station has sent you a file for one Captain Ram Saetang. Picking up the tablet and making your way to the small coffee maker in your quarters you note that it is a redacted dossier right about the same time you remember that you agreed to join his lost cause of a patrol mission if he impressed you.

Huh.

Most people that get stationed out here aren’t too keen to share their files, but you guess Capt. Saetang covered for that by making sure it was redacted. Or maybe the Station did. A quick glance at the stats on the front page before your morning ablutions manages to raise an eyebrow. He really is as young as he looks. Twenty-seven and already a captain. The rest you read before heading to a concourse and what passes for breakfast. A proper latte and a shitty periphery croissant. Mmm, shitty buttery baked goods.  

Captain Ram Saetang, familiar name Danny, entered into Sol System Defense at 18 like most Thais. Proficient vehicle pilot fast tracked into Mech licenses and selected for advanced training by General Reginald Saelim. Graduated as a brevet lieutenant and then shipped off for various posts. Served with distinction for most of his career, even if a lot of it is redacted. One particularly lengthy section lines up with the Rosatom Suppression, which tracks. Made Commander after that, given a squad. 

Self-identified relationship with Captain Kamon Saelim. 

Putting two and two together, you google the name and sure enough, she’s the only daughter of General Reginald Saelim. And also now a pacifist. Family gatherings must be fun. Oh wait, the general passed a few years back, apparently. 

Continuing to read, you then discover that they rescinded the identification of the relationship a year later. What fun. His squad got caught up in one of the deep Core raids by the Star Corsairs, after which he transferred to the CDF. Entire squad transferred with him. Huh.

You’re almost at the cargo bay, so you drop the tablet into the lab coat’s deep pockets and focus on your work.

“Report, lieutenant.”

A medical staff member salutes. “Analysis operations are progressing well, Commander. We’ll probably be ready for human trials before the weekend. There is… something of a problem on board the transport ship.”

“A problem? They’ve been in transit for almost a week, I’d think something this virulent would have shown signs of mutation or complications well before now.”

“Not with the virus, ma’am. The refugees are restless and the crew aren’t particularly well trained to deal with this sort of situation. There have been altercations. No casualties yet, but the commander of the ship isn’t confident of his ability to maintain the peace. He’s requesting marines-”

“Oh for god’s sake. He doesn’t need marines, he just needs to reassure them.” 

You storm off, bringing the tablet up and making a request to the station to put you through to the commander of the transport.  

“Commander Amerdi. You’re having some issues with your charges I hear?”

“Ah, Commander duMaurier, yes. In the interests of preventing any injuries to any parties, I’d like to request a detachment of, well, professional soldiers-”

“Denied, Commander. What are the refugees’ complaints?”

“What, you can’t-”

“I’m in command of the theatre, so yes, I can. This is routine discontent and should be easily solved. Or at least put off until we can process the refugees. Now, what’s their problem?”

He doesn’t look convinced, but responds “Mostly they have issues with the rationing system and lack of contact with the outside.”

“Rationing? We’ve sent over enough resources for their entire stay plus a day.”

“Well, yes, but we can’t process them fast enough, so we’re substituting crew rations to meet mealtimes.  And to cover that loss, I’m feeding my crew at later times, but with the fabrikators constantly running we need to use some of the refugees’ resources-”

“Which looks like you’re using their allotted food for yourselves. Damn. Alright, I’ll have some field fabrikators sent over. Not going to do as good a job, but we can give them direct control over them, give them a sense of agency.”

“Oh! Well, that’s… yes, I think that would go a long ways, thank you Commander.”

“Now, why can’t they communicate with the outside.”

“Civilian comms, ma’am. They can’t reach the station.”

“Right. And we can’t route them through the ship’s because of regulations. Fine, I’ll see about having someone sign off on an exception to bring the ship in closer. It’s all vacuum one way or another.”

You close the connection and see about finding someone to do that. 

--

Regardless of how much more casual the CDF might be, it’s still a military so that little excursion costs you a few hours. By the time you’re in a shuttle over to the transport ship, your staff has sourced enough field fabrikators to take on the load of processing the refugees’ resources. 

By the time the shuttle has put down in the transport ship’s bay, you have the outlines of a speech written in your head. You disembark with your staff, and years of trundling around in these getups has taught you some neat tricks. Splaying your hands wide you haul back and slap them together, the rubber coming together perfectly for a super satisfyingly loud CLAP. 

“Now that I’ve got your attention, I’ve got some announcements. One, a cure and vaccine will be ready for human trials by Sunday. Setting some expectations, that’s still a trial so bear with us. Two, I understand that there’s some anger over food distribution. I’ve spoken with Commander Amerdi and have brought enough field fabrikators so that you don’t need to rely on the ships’ to process your sweet, sweet space rations. Use them responsibly. If this ship turns Lord of the Flies I will be very disappointed. You don’t want to disappoint the woman in charge of your recovery do you? Thirdly, Commander Amerdi and I have argued for permission to enter into a holding pattern closer to Perimeter Station. Your comms should be able to reach the Station’s now and contact friends, loved ones, tiktok, whatever.

“Now, who wants to get stabbed for some more blood samples?”

After you get vented and put on your labcoat, you figure you deserve a break, and that’s when you remember you were reading Captain Saetang’s dossier. So, over a horrendous smoothie that’s about the healthiest thing you’ll eat all day, you finish off the last 6 months of the man’s career.

Entire squad lost defending Bonnie’s Landing from mixed pirate raid. Eyes damaged beyond repair. Pirates quit the field, inflicting minimal damages and not making off with many resources of note. 

Well. That’s a depressing note to end on. To kill the rest of your break, you try to find the entirety of the man’s pitch to the Bureau and higher-ups. It’s publicly available with enough searching and as you read through it there are significant citations to the works of Kamon Saelim. As a whole, the task force idea isn’t a terrible one, but at its reduced strength…

You think of five pilots holding back a pirate raid with orbital support. 

You think of the populace of the planet those refugees came from that weren’t able to survive until a ship came through.

Dammit. You weren’t going to sleep with him anyways. 

You fire off an acceptance and get back to work.
