"And we're out here why again?" mutters one of his squadmates. Captain Jorge Bensson of SecCorp Mech Command frowns.

"Because we've got reports of unidentified vehicles, probably mechs, out here that our forward sensors can't pick up. And Intelligence is pretty sure the seedies have some kind of stealth tech, so we're doing our jobs and investigating. Idiot."

There's a brief burst of muttering that's muted by the comms noise detection and finally the captain has some peace and quiet. The valley up ahead is heavily forested, but getting into position should give them good overwatch of the whole thing. With a Grand Warden, two Bruisers and two Shrikes, along with support IFVs, Dome Control is confident he can deal with whatever is out here, if anything. They're pretty confident in the fact that a heavy lander couldn't have touched down without them knowing, so a few drop ships at most are expected.  

"Got something like a contact, captain, in the riverbed."

*The riverbed? That's exposed.* "Bring it up."

A hazy sensor profile comes up and he recognizes almost immediately. "What the hell is one of our MBT's doing out here?"

"Dunno sir."

"Shrikes, move up and get direct sensor locks on that thing."

The light mechs move up and he send the IFVs with a Bruiser as escort wide to support or flank if this is a trap, while he and the other Bruiser head up the hill. The Shrikes lock on and IFF comes back positive with a serial number and everything. Shortly, they're able to hit the MBT with laser comms. 

"Oh thank god, we're glad you're here. I knew they'd send someone eventually," comes a voice over the comms.

"Identify yourself, please," Captain Bensson asks.

"Corporal Louisa Ho, Dome 2 defense, sir. We got separated during exercises when our nav malfunctioned and then we, ah, had an accident that landed us here."

Bensson crests the hill overlooking the valley presently, finally able to take the situation in personally. A single MBT in SecCorp yellow is thoroughly stuck in the riverbed, its front end buried in mud and water, its turret barely angled to keep it from the same fate.

"How long have you been out here, Corporal Ho?" Bensson taps into the satellite network to verify a missing MBT and the corporal's identity while positioning his forces to encircle the tank. "A little over a week, sir. Water's fine, but rations weren't looking too good. I was really hoping the tank's engine sig would register to those civilian craft that kept passing near, and I guess it finally did when we ramped it."

Bensson takes a look at the MBT's sensor profile, and the vehicle *was* running particularly hot. "No thought of firing your weapons to attract attention, Corporal?"

"Well, we weren't authorized for live fire, sir. But I figured I'd take the disciplinary and fire the lasers if we ran out of rations."

Frowning, Bensson purses his lips, wondering at the corporal's commander's attitude if she was that afraid of a disciplinary action. That, or this corporal had no business leading a tank unit.

"Alright corporal, we'll pull you out." responds Bensson. The MBT's serial number had come back valid and was listed as missing. He sends a jumpjet-equipped Bruiser down to pull the tank out, while putting the Shrikes on patrol. Zooming in on the tank, he can see figures waving and he returns the gesture with the Grand Warden's colossal arm. 

By the time Bruiser is in position, the tank crew have buttoned themselves back in and Bensson is following up to see what happened with his personnel request of Louisa Ho. At almost the same time it comes back negative, the sensor board lights up.

"Conta- aaagh!" A shrike explodes from a strange greenish-blue blast as more contacts come live across the valley. Sensors immediately identify them as light and medium mechs but are unable to classify them, which is really of less interest to the captain as he sets about getting locks on them. About the time when he's about to unleash a missile barrage, the MBT's turret swings around and opens up with both laser cannons, completely decapitating the Bruiser sent to retrieve it.

Snarling, Captain Jorge Bensson hits the fire button and his GW2M opens up with four missile launchers and two MMMLs, blanketing the valley in missile fire. As the explosions roll through a contact pops up in front of him, a slow light mech well within his missile range, but easy meat for his machine guns. Then he gets visual on it and takes in the completely outsized revolver-like cannon affixed to its shoulder and swears.

"Fucking pirates! IFVs! RTB and report, everyone else, form on me and focus down targets." Revolver cannon or not, Bensson's Grand Warden outmassed the light by twice its weight, so he set it into a lumber charge to slam into it. 

The cannon booms with a sound he can feel inside his cockpit and the GW2M *lurches* with the force of the projectile as alarms go off, informing him of an armor breach on his left side. The Revolver dodges to the right to avoid him, but he keeps it in his sights, opening up with MGs, but notices too late the speeding medium behind it, charging him with what looks like a lance. He tries to swing around, but his momentum is too much, and the Bourne's strike digs into his exposed torso. There's an ear-shattering *pop* and his mech goes dark.

A moment of silence, then "What the fuck...?" is all Captain Jorge Bensson has time to utter before the Revolver blows his cockpit to shreds.

Slowly, oh so slowly, Admiral Ballabh Kehar closes the lid on his workstation and leans back in his chair. Reading, reviewing and re-reporting on the disaster in the Alshain system was an act so draining for a long while he didn't know what to do with himself except stare into the grey of his office. Long moments pass like this before he gets a hold of himself and turns towards the window, getting out of his chair and approaching it. Out there, the great orb of Earth spun, enmeshed in the crystalline web of orbital elevators, tramways and stations. Sixteen billion people, living and thriving. 

The Alshain system had been home to six hundred million people - a well developed core colony. This... Eater of Worlds had come in, hit the primary planet and spread across the system like a virus. It had taken barely sixteen hours for Alshain Prime to be fully consumed and the destruction of the system was complete within another five days. He still shudders at the visuals that ships fleeing from the system had managed to pass on. The enormous spires of flesh and chitin, mockeries of space elevators. The strike craft shaped like obscene cuttlefish. The vast vats and lakes of liquid that buildings, vehicles and people alike were dumped into. 

One of his granddaughters played a vintage game that represented a monster like this very similarly - but it didn't compare. 

The warning from the Wandering Remnant, passed on by Recon-In-Force, had not been taken seriously enough. And now an entire core system was gone, along with who know how many periphery and stray systems. And the beast was nowhere to be found, having cast itself back into the black void of space once... whatever objective it had was achieved. Consumption? To what end? How did it know when to stop? The outer reaches of Alshain were untouched, and by all reports still had exploitable resources. Perhaps it recognized it would spend more resources consuming those than it would gain? Impossible to know. And virtually impossible to guard against, save to the QCDs-

His door chimes. Turning from the window, he composes himself.

"Come."

"Admiral, sir." His aide, a young lieutenant, salutes. "You've just received another report on the Eater of Worlds - this time striking at Toliman."

Ballabh closes his eyes. "How many dead?"

"None sir, though the colonial administration is extremely irate."

"Excuse me?" Ballabh's eyes snap open. 

"The captain on station at Toliman II had spent time reading the Remnant/Recon documents and made the judgement call to use nukes. The Eater never broke atmosphere."

Ballabh blinks. He recalls that the Remnant had said that the Eater could be dealt with before entering a gravity well, but given the scale of its destruction, he assumed that it would take... well, a small fleet. "How many craft did this captain have?"

"One heavy cruiser. Many of the nukes were delivered by strike aerospace craft, apparently. Took less time than re-arming the missiles."

Ballabh nods. Good thinking on the part of that captain. "And the colonial administration is... irate?"

"Yessir. The EMP took out... well, most of the colony's infrastructure and so they've had a time getting it back up. Administration has arrested SSD staff sent down to help with the restoration-"

"They what?" asks Ballabh mildly. "No, don't answer that. I can see it. Strange sighting, followed immediately by nukes? I can see their concern. That being said... what has the captain on station's reaction been?"

"Repeated protests and escalation to command, sir."

"Well, escalation received. Get a relief force out there, with the new QCDs. Head it up under... that angry Carib general, you know the one, yes? Make sure he has the visuals from Alshain to make his points."

Ballabh returns to his desk with renewed vigour. The thing can be beaten. They have the means. Dangerous means, but means nonetheless. And the early warning system, though slow, is starting to go out. Now they just had to accelerate their deployment and prepare the galaxy for FTL communication. Easy, right?
