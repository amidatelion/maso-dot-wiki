# Combat
**Light Cover**: grants a -1 to be hit. Light cover is penetrable by equivalent-scale weapons and the target is easily visible in it. It does not grant cover against larger-scale weapons.      
**Heavy Cover**: grants -3 to be hit. Heavy cover is not penetrable by equivalent-scale weapons and the target is difficult to see in it. Larger-scale weapons reduce the penalty by -1.    
**Full Cover**: does not allow equivalent-scale weapons to hit and the target is not visible. Larger scale weapons may attempt to hit the target with a -5 penalty.     

**Burst fire**:         
  - *SMGs*: Between short and medium range, +5 to hit if stationary, +3 during Advance movement, +2 during Dash. Costs 3 ammo.     
  - *Rifles*: Between short and long range, +3 to hit if stationary, +2 during Advance movement, -2 during Dash. Costs 3 ammo.

  - *Rifles*: -15 to hit, but for every number past your target roll, you may roll damage again. Costs 15 ammo.      

**Scything**: A Full-Auto roll that attempts to hit multiple targets. The target difficulty increases by 1 per target.       

**Spray-n-Pray**: A Full-Auto attack where you fire on a target you can't see, i.e. sticking your weapon out of cover or firing blind into the fog. You can only ever hit once. You may replace Nerves with Wit for this roll and if you do, you strain your senses for a clue of your target's position, getting +1 on subsequent attempts to hit.
