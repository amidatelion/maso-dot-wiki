# First Aid
First aid kits come in a variety of capabilities. The lower grade ones are very common and can be reasonably easily assembled, while the higher-grade ones are prized trade items, as the average survivor has no need of their capabilities. Kits have a limited amount of HP they can restore, as well as Injury healing they can do at the cost of that HP reserve.

# Injectors
WWIII marked the onset of widespread use of combat drugs, pioneered by Russian special forces operating deep behind NATO lines. While these units fates were almost universally gruesome, their rampant success caused the spread of the practice across Europe.
