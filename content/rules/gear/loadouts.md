Outside this beta, this page would be used for other reasons, but we're doing away with Load and weight for the most part. Instead, have a look through the Loadouts below. The only thing to keep in mind from the Load rules is that a lower weight aids in stealth.

# Load
A character can carry a Weight equal to $number x their Body stat. This is not a 1:1 with pounds or kilos, to allow for abstraction and ease of using traits. 

If their carried load is in excess of their load, they are Overloaded. They can only move at Advance speed. All climb checks, even with equipment, require checks. Their movements are louder.  

Some gear provides a negative Weight, by distributing it more evenly. Think how hiking packs distribute weight. These are commonly rigs and packs, though there might be pieces of more exotic gear that help.
