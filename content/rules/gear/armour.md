## Armour basics
Armours come in a great many types. Mostly they are vests, but more elaborated fits exist. Armors have an Armor Value (AV). They block damage based on that AV. Note that many ammunitions have a Penetration Value (PV) that bypass certain amounts of AV.

Examples:  

Jay is wearing Kevlar, which has an AV of 3. He is shot by a pistol shooting QuakeMaker ammo which has a PV of 0. The pistol rolls a 3. Quakemaker ignores 0 AV. The damage is reduced by the Kevlar's AV or 3 to 0. He takes no damage.  

He is then shot by another pistol, shooting PSO, which has a PV of 1. It also rolls a 3. PSO ignores 1 AV and so the Kevlar's AV is 2, which reduces the damage to 1. He takes 1 damage.  

He is then shot by a rifle firing FMJ, which has a PV of 4. It also rolls a 3. FMJ ignores 4 AV, so none of the the kevlar's AV applies. Jay takes 3 damage.
