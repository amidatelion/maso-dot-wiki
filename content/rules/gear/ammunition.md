**Tearing**: On a critical, automatically inflict the Injury "Bleeding"
**Subsonic**: Can be Effectively Silenced, i.e. not heard outside a room. Non-subsonic ammunition can be Silenced, but will still be heard for a good distance, though the direction is frequently confused.
**Shattering**: On a critical, automatically inflict the Injury "Fracture."
**Vehicle-scale**: Immediately Down an Infantry character, inflict damage as normal to vehicles. 
**Incendiary**: Set objects on fire. Note: Object must have enough effective thickness to arm the incendiary - ergo the round is unlikely to arm if fired into an unarmored body. Armored though... hoooo buddy.
