Unit Morale is invisibly tracked on a scale from 0 to 20. That is, the GM tracks it and it is invisible to the players.

Morale starts at the beginning of a campaign at a level determined by the GM and can be increased by player actions and decreased by enemy actions (or, with really bad roles/plans, player actions). If morale ever hits 0 a zero morale event happens. This is bad. Avoid this. Morale lower than 5 is considered Low. If morale ever goes over 15, certain effects become more... exciting. However, because they're riding high, players may suffer interesting side effects when they lose morale as reality vibe checks them. Certain players may get insight into the relative morale of the unit, allowing them to know if morale is High, Low or Neutral.

Morale can be spent to resist injuries, increase skill rolls in combat or otherwise high stakes encounters. A card game does not count - negotiating for a SecCorp cruiser's surrender does. 1 point of morale can be spent per-roll, unless otherwise specified. Note that because players never know the exact morale, they should be careful when spending points - but holding on to them puts you into the volatile High Morale status, which might not be great for some playersâ€™ mental health.
