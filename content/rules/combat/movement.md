A player may move their speed in combat. On foot, their speed is fixed. In a vehicle, they have three speeds: combat, cruising, flat out, noted on the sheet. A combat speed is slowest, but allows for the best maneuverability and is always available. Cruising is meant for covering large distance and in order to enter cruising speed, a vehicle must have spent 1 round at combat speed as it takes time to accelerate. To move at cruising speed, a pilot must use 1 move action to move, and 1 more to move at cruising. A pilot making anything more than basic course adjustments must succeed on a Reaction check against a target of 10. 

Flat out works similarly, except that for every round the vehicle has spent in flat out, its heat increments by one. To move at flat out speed, a pilot must use 1 move action to move, and 2 more to move at flat out. Even basic maneuvering during flat out speeds requires a Reaction check against a target of 10 and making complex course corrections must be made against a target of 15.  

Terrain and the environment may impede movement. Difficult terrain halves speed and dangerous terrain causes effects listed or described by the GM.  
{{< panel title="Under Construction" style="warning" >}} Representing Speed is difficult. I don't have the energy these days to properly do up nice maps and tokens, but ideally that's how this would go. Beta release will likely tackle this in more detail. {{< /panel >}}
