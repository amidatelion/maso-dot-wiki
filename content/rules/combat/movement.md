A player may move their speed in combat.  

# Infantry Movement
Infantry have great flexibility in movement. Unburdened infantry have two speeds: Advance and Dash

**Advance**: 15 feet per round, no accuracy penalty  
**Dash**: 30 feet per round, -10 accuracy, Loud  

They may move their speed horizontally across any terrain, though that terrain may force checks that can affect their speed. Infantry that are overloaded also move at half their speed. 

Infantry can ascend 1 level per round vertically with appropriate tools - i.e. a ladder, pitons, etc. Certain surfaces can be climbed without tooling and a relevant check.  

# Vehicle Movement
In a vehicle, players have three speeds: Combat, Cruising, Flat Out. Combat speed is slowest, but allows for the best maneuverability and is always available, unless the vehicle has damage to certain components. Cruising is meant for covering large distance and in order to enter cruising speed, a vehicle must have spent 1 round at Combat speed as it takes time to accelerate. Maintaining the cruising speed is a single move action. A pilot making anything more than basic course adjustments must succeed on a Nerves check against a target of 10. 

Flat Out works similarly, except that for every round the vehicle has spent in flat out, its heat increments by one. In order to enter Flat Out, a vehicle must have spent 1 round at combat speed as it takes time to accelerate. Maintaining the Flat Out speed is a single move action. Even basic maneuvering during flat out speeds requires a Nerves check against a target of 10 and making complex course corrections must be made against a target of 15.  

Terrain and the environment may impede movement. Difficult terrain halves speed and dangerous terrain causes effects listed or described by the GM.
