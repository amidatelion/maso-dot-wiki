Damage can broadly be split into Infantry and Vehicle Damage models.

# Infantry Damage
Damage against a person or beast or really anything organic is done against their HP and usually blocked by armour. Infantry armour blocks damage. So when a shot connects, it does its damage first to the armour and then to the wearer’s hit points. Hit points are defined your Body stat - namely 5 x your Body (minimum of 10). Once a player’s hit points are depleted, they take an injury and their hit points reset. Damage numbers are also not necessarily a 1-for-1 depictions of damage. If a bullet hits you and 2 damage goes through, you don't necessarily have a bullet hole in you - bullet impacts through armor *fucking hurt*!

By default, characters have 2 injury "slots." 

The nature of the injury may penalize the reset hit points. Once a player has suffered their maximum amount of injuries, they are considered downed, not necessarily dead. 

However, further damage will rapidly hasten the onset of death.  

# Defying death
When downed, a character has two options: staying down or trying to defy death. Staying down is free and incurs no consequences

To defy death you roll 3d6 + Body or Wits, depending on the situation.
