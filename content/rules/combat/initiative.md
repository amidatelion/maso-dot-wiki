Initiative isn’t rolled for or set like some games. It is seized, which means whoever wants to go next, can. On the first round of combat, someone seizes the “first” position. If two people want that position, one or the other can concede or they roll off. A seize roll is 1d20 + any modifiers. Ties result in another roll off. The process repeats until everyone has seized a place in the initiative order. If a player fails to seize the initiative, they take a cumulative -1 to all seize rolls, all of which can be removed by deferring to a lower initiative order as they back off and regroup.

Players can remain in this initiative order for the remainder of combat, or they can defer or try to seize a higher initiative position each round. Deferring simply means dropping to a lower initiative position. Seizing a new position is a roll-off, with some extra steps. The seizing player rolls as normal and the “defending” player gets a bonus based on how many positions are between them and the seizing player.
