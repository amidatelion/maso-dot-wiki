Attacks are a Nerves check on 3d6 against a target 15 with any relevant modifiers. This includes the player’s modifiers and the target’s, of which there can be many, and is where the complexity in M.A.S.O really comes from. Aside from weapon modifiers, here are some common ones

## Size Differences

Targets gain size penalties and bonuses based on size differences. For every size category that a target is larger than the player, the player gets a +1 bonus against. For every size category that a target is smaller than the player, the player gets a -1 bonus against. 

## Speed

An infantry unit that has traded a major action for move actions gains +1 to be hit. This stacks, as when pushing yourself.  

For every 50kph a vehicle has moved in its previous turn, it gains a +1 to be hit. Note that there are a wealth of weapon systems that exist to mitigate this.

## Cover

**Light Cover** grants a -1 to be hit. Light cover is penetrable by equivalent-scale weapons and the target is easily visible in it. It does not grant cover against larger-scale weapons.

**Heavy Cover** grants -3 to be hit. Heavy cover is not penetrable by equivalent-scale weapons and the target is difficult to see in it. Larger-scale weapons reduce the penalty by -1.

**Full Cover** does not allow equivalent-scale weapons to hit and the target is not visible. Larger scale weapons may attempt to hit the target with a -5 penalty. 

## Called Shots

## Scaled weapnry

Being hit with weaponry of a different scale is devastating. An infantry character hit by a vehicle weapon will likely not survive and will frequently be injured by a near miss. A vehicle hit by a ship-based weapon is likely scrap or have components blow off by a near miss.
