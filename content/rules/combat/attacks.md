Attacks are a Reaction check on a d20 against a target 15 with any relevant modifiers. This includes the player’s modifiers and the target’s, of which there can be many, and is where the complexity in M.A.S.O really comes from. Aside from weapon modifiers, here are some common ones

# Size Differences

Targets gain size penalties and bonuses based on size differences. For every size category that a target is larger than the player, the player gets a +1 bonus against. For every size category that a target is smaller than the player, the player gets a -1 bonus against. 

# Speed

For every 100kph a unit has moved in its previous turn, it gains a +1 to be hit. Note that there are a wealth of weapon systems that exist to mitigate this.

# Cover

**Light Cover** grants a -1 to be hit. Light cover is penetrable by equivalent-scale weapons and the target is easily visible in it. It does not grant cover against larger-scale weapons.

**Medium Cover** grants -3 to be hit. Medium cover is not penetrable by equivalent-scale weapons and the target is difficult to see in it. Larger-scale weapons reduce the penalty by -1.

**Full Cover** does not allow equivalent-scale weapons to hit and the target is not visible. Larger scale weapons may attempt to hit the target with a -5 penalty.
