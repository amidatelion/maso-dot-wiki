Attacks are a Nerves check on 3d6 against a target 15 with any relevant modifiers. This includes the player’s modifiers and the target’s, of which there can be many, and is where the complexity in M.A.S.O really comes from. Aside from weapon modifiers, here are some common ones    
    
## Size Differences    
    
Targets gain size penalties and bonuses based on size differences. For every size category that a target is larger than the player, the player gets a +1 bonus against. For every size category that a target is smaller than the player, the player gets a -1 bonus against.     
    
## Speed    
    
An infantry unit that has traded a major action for move actions gains +1 to be hit. This stacks, as when pushing yourself.      
    
For every 50kph a vehicle has moved in its previous turn, it gains a +1 to be hit. Note that there are a wealth of weapon systems that exist to mitigate this.    
    
## Cover    
    
**Light Cover** grants a -1 to be hit. Light cover is penetrable by equivalent-scale weapons and the target is easily visible in it. It does not grant cover against larger-scale weapons.    
    
**Heavy Cover** grants -3 to be hit. Heavy cover is not penetrable by equivalent-scale weapons and the target is difficult to see in it. Larger-scale weapons reduce the penalty by -1.    
    
**Full Cover** does not allow equivalent-scale weapons to hit and the target is not visible. Larger scale weapons may attempt to hit the target with a -5 penalty.     
    
## Fire modes    
    
Weapons may have differing firing modes. Trained individuals tend to rely on single-fire with burst fire being useful at medium-long range to increase hit chances. Bandits, cultists and the like are more likely to magdump on full-auto, though there are usecases for that even for trained individuals.    
    
**Single shot**: No changes. Costs 1 ammo.    
**Burst fire**:     
  - *Pistols*: N/A      
  - *SMGs*: Between short and medium range, +5 to hit if stationary, +3 during Advance movement, +2 during Dash. Costs 3 ammo.     
  - *Rifles*: Between short and long range, +3 to hit if stationary, +2 during Advance movement, -2 during Dash. Costs 3 ammo.    
**Full Auto**:      
  - *Pistols*: N/A      
  - *SMGs*: -10 to hit, but for every number past your target roll, you may roll damage again. Costs 15 ammo.      
  - *Rifles*: -15 to hit, but for every number past your target roll, you may roll damage again. Costs 15 ammo.      
**Scything**: A Full-Auto roll that attempts to hit multiple targets. The target difficulty increases by 1 per target.      
**Spray-n-Pray**: A Full-Auto attack where you fire on a target you can't see, i.e. sticking your weapon out of cover or firing blind into the fog. You can only ever hit once. You may replace Nerves with Wit for this roll and if you do, you strain your senses for a clue of your target's position, getting +1 on subsequent attempts to hit.       
    
## Called Shots    
    
You may make a called shot against a target at a -5 to hit, specifying a location. This can be the wheel of a car, or some poor fuck's dome. Great for low-PV ammo or heavily armoured vehicles.        
    
## Scaled weapnry    
    
Being hit with weaponry of a different scale is devastating. An infantry character hit by a vehicle weapon will likely not survive and will frequently be injured by a near miss. A vehicle hit by a ship-based weapon is likely scrap or have components blow off by a near miss.       
    
## Melee attacks    
    
Melee attacks are contested Body checks as the combatants grapple and try to avoid getting hurt. Its safe to assume everyone has a backup knife, so attacks are still lethal.      
    
A contested check is when parties roll and compare differences. The person with the higher roll, after all modifications, wins. Note that some armors are better at resisting slashing and piercing damage than others.
