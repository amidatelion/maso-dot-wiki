You only need two dice for M.A.S.O. A d20 and a d6. Well, maybe a lot of d6s. But you can make do with just the one.  

Rolls are virtually only ever done for combat and where they’re not, they’re usually for contested actions. This means that out of combat situations force the players to think and present the GM with believable responses to situations, getting creative to overcome real challenges. In contested situations, the d20 does the legwork, with the d6 relegated to only doing damage and some limited table rolls - combat stuff. 

A roll is a success if it beats the target number. The target number is usually 15, with more mundane actions going as low as 10. Certain challenging situations will require rolls higher than 15. Ties count as failures.
