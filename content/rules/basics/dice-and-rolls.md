You only need 1 type of die for M.A.S.O. - but preferably 3d6. But you can make do with just the one.  

All checks, whether they be attack rolls or skill checks, are done on 3d6 and target 15 for success. These checks are modified by the situation, stats and traits. 

# Criticals
Criticals in M.A.S.O are scored on dice runs - similar or adjacent die rolls. Here's a simple list - if on a check you roll these numbers, you score a critical.

123  
234  
345  
456  
  
111  
222  
333  
444  
555  
666  

You may note that many of these rolls do not hit the usual target number of 15. However, with the right set of modifiers, a 6 (2,2,2) can hit 15. 

What happens when you roll a run and you don't make your target number?  

Bad things.
