## Stats

There are only three stats in M.A.S.O - Body, Nerves, and Wit. The baseline of all of these is zero, with each point granting a bonus on rolls associated with it. These are fairly self explanatory and but a cursory explanation follows:

**Body**: Represents feats of strength and endurance.  
**Nerves**: Represents feats of precision and reflexes.  
**Wit**: Represents feats of mental and interpersonal nature.   

### Increasing Stats

The cost to increase Stats increases logarhythmically. For the purposes of this run, consider Stats capped at 5, though the GM could be convinced to go beyond. For comparison, an Olympian is probably a 7. In the greater M.A.S.O ruleset, anything 8 or higher is considered Peak Human and usually requires genetic modification to accomplish.

## Traits

Traits are where the character modifications come from in M.A.S.O. You’ll note that Body, Nerves and Wit are pretty limited in what they describe. They are also numerically limited. Traits are characteristics that grant situational modifiers that better describe what a character’s capabilities are. There are positive traits, trade-off traits and negative traits. A positive trait grants +1 to rolls on subjects mentioned in the trait. A trade-off grants +1 to some rolls and -1 to others. A negative trait grants -1 to rolls on subjects mentioned in the trait. Trade-off traits are generally only granted on character creation or by the GM for situations and behaviours as they see fit.  

On character generation, a player gets 1 positive trait, and a trade-off trait. A trade-off trait have equal positives and negatives. They may also “purchase” more positive traits by also taking negative ones. This is capped at 3 for character generation but otherwise, no cap exists. 

Traits should be characterful and represent a character’s experience - they can describe any situation, inside or outside of combat. See the sample characters for ideas. 

## Injuries

A player has 2 injuries available to them to start. These are only used in combat and are mitigated by hit points. Even if you get into a bar fight, you will not take an injury. I mean, unless you escalate the situation. 

Gaining injuries is under development.

## Hit Points
Hit points are defined your Body stat - namely 10 x your Body (minimum of 10). Once a player’s hit points are depleted, they take an injury and their hit points reset.
