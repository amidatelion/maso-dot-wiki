## Introduction 

A character is almost entirely role-played. When creating a character your effort should be on developing their past and career. From there it makes choosing your stats and traits much easier and you have a more rounded character at the end of it. 

## Generation
On generation, a character has 1 positive trait, 1 negative trait and 1 trade-off trait to define their skills with.They may also “purchase” more positive traits by also taking negative ones. They also have three Ability Points. These can be split between stats and licenses. One Ability Point equals one stat point - these are straight upgrades and can be applied as seen fit.

On character generation, a player gets 1 positive trait, and a trade-off trait. They may also “purchase” more positive traits by also taking negative ones. This is capped at 3 for character generation but otherwise, no cap exists. 

## Descriptors

Write some easy descriptors for your character to get the point across real quick

## Licenses
Licenses determine what vehicle can be driven or piloted. Everyone in M.A.S.O. starts with a Basic License. Congrats, you can drive a car, and therefore tanks, IFVs and all basic vehicles. Licenses sometimes have prerequisites, as seen on the tables below:

\* Can be operated without license - problems will crop up

Note: On first glance this gives infantry a statistical advantage and dedicated tank/vehicle drivers especially. However, given the sheer firepower disadvantage they face, this is basically required. Even a tank driver might be blown free of a tank much more quickly than a mech pilot and so will have to rely on their Body, Nerves and Wit without mechanical aid more.
