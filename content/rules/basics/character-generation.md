# Introduction 

A character is almost entirely role-played. When creating a character your effort should be on developing their past and career. From there it makes choosing your stats and traits much easier and you have a more rounded character at the end of it. 

# Generation

## Background

Your background is a general statement about your origins. For this campaign, they are made more opinionated, and should be picked from whatever faction the group decides to start from.

### CRTG

**Scandinavian**: You hail from the socialist countries to the north. You are generally more fit than others but can be viewed as a bit standoffish. You gain one positive Body trait and one negative Wits trait that relates to social undertakings. 

**Isles**: You're from the British Isles. Generally hard-drinking and gregarious, you gain a trade-off trait related to alcohol, as well as a positive trait related to social interactions.

**Canadian**: Hailing from the Great White North, you gain a positive Body trait related to survival. However, you take a negative Wits trait that reflects your wishywashy or unopinionated nature.

**Brazilian**: It's a little known fact that Brazilians have shown up for every world war. To reflect the wake of good vibes they tend to leave, you gain a positive trait related to morale. However, to reflect the general poor state of Brazil, you gain a negative Wits trait related to education, and a trade-off Body and Nerves trait.

### The Corporate State of Ion

**European**: This is your backyard, and even the least travelled of you have been around - even if it has been in more urban, non-blown-up areas. You gain a trade-off trait related to navigating the world. You also gain a positive Wits trait relating to securing supplies.

**American**: The world blames your people for the current apocalyptic situation, and so you take a negative Wits trait related to social Wits interactions. Your culture being so overly focused on guns gives you a positive Nerves trait related to combat, however.  

**Baltic**: Russia's massive push westward displaced hundreds of thousands of people. You gain a trade-off trait related to Russians. To reflect the fact that you're from a famously multilingual area, you gain a positive Wits trait related to languages.  

**Middle Eastern**: Not a particularly well-loved group before the HAARP event, everything that you've survived has honed you for this world. You gain a trade-off trait as you like, a positive Body, Nerves or wits trait related to survival and a negative Wits trait related to whitey.   


### The Fleet

**Fleet Original**: An American from the mainland, you enlisted or signed on as an officer. You suffer from the same negative public opinion as ION Americans, and so take a negative Wits trait related to social Wits interactions. Your Nerves bonus is to vehicle handling in some capacity however.  

**2nd Gen**: Born on the fleet, you've never known anything different, except maybe the occasional coastal town. You gain a negative trait regarding the great outdoors, but a positive trait on Wits and Nerves checks regarding heavy machinery.  

**Conscript**: Towards the end of the main fighting of WWIII, the US really upped the conscription rate. Plucked right out of school, you suffer on Wits checks related to anything covered from higher education. However, being in the military from such a young age, you gain a positive trait for any stat on checks related to anything military or combat.

**French**: Early calls of cheese-eating surrender monkeys got dropped pretty quick when it became clear how consistently the French were fighting the good fight, even from the Med. You gain a trade-off trait regarding morale and a negative trait regarding Wits checks about your honor or valour.  


## Career  

### CRTG

**Driver**: Even the most skilled spec-ops need transportation. Either through training or experience you've gotten real good at making vehicles go. You gain a free license for vehicles you qualify for, and a trade-off trait for any that you don't.

**Spec-Ops**: You are the best of the best and have very clear objectives and enemies. Gain a positive trait on any stats in situations regarding combat. Gain a trade-off trait on checks regarding cultists or other HAARP related subjects.  

**Spook**: You haven't been in contact with your home agency in nearly decades, but your training is still with you. You gain a positive check on Wits checks to checks regarding information, but you take negative trait regarding morale checks.

### The Corporate State of ION

**Corpo**: You came up on the administrative side of ION and you were good at what you did. You gain a negative trait in regards to Nerves and Body combat checks, a trade-off check regarding any checks relating to negotiate, but you gain a positive Wits trait.

**Civilian**: You signed up with ION as they formed their corporate state, eager to make a better life for yourself. You gain a positive Wits trait regarding social checks with other Europeans, but a negative trait regarding morale checks.

**Freelancer**: You're the wide-ranging front-line of ION's post-Apocalyptic defence. Not necessarily the best trained, but well liked. You gain two trade-off traits related to combat, alongside a trade-off Wits trait dealing with Europeans.

### The Fleet

**Navy**: You move people around. That's, like, your entire deal. But you're not necessarily the pilot or navigator. Gain 1 license for a vehicle you qualify for, as well as a positive trait for Nerves and Wits check on checks for machinery

**Marines**: Jarheads. Crayon-eaters. You're what remains of the expeditionary forces that initially tried to hold the Eastern Front. You gain two positive traits related to combat as well as a negative Wits or Nerve check related to morale. You can also request a 

**Pilot**: A different kind of best of the best. You gain two licenses towards vehicles you qualify for. Additionally you gain a negative trait regarding small-arms combat. That shit's for peasants, after all.
