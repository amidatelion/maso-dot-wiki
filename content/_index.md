{{< hint info >}}
MASO was, originally, a prototype tabletop roleplaying game that took its cues from Battletech, mecha anime, and [Lancer](https://massif-press.itch.io/corebook-pdf).  

This version... isn't that. It's purely an exploration of the infantry rules. Maybe some vehicles. It is set in Ignis Company's [HAARP universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie13GMC3fTA&list=PLmHznWsTk8BTJofMfAf_E4Ee0hxn0dURA) and blends its world with Shadowrun-inspired crunch and Tarkov-inspired survival mechanics.

# The Pitch

On November 4th, 2018, in the midst of World War Three, the United States activated the High Active Auroral Research Project in an attempt to cause widespread, non-nuclear damage to Russian, Iranian and Chinese military and civilian infrastructure. Ten days later, the Russian allied nuclear response offlined the US' ability to control the Project facilities in what would become known as The HAARP Event, ushering in almost two decades of hyper-extreme weather and nuclear fallout.   

Eighteen years later, on February 18, 2036, WWIII finally ended in the brief conflict known as the Storm War. A coalition of forces from the Corporate State of ION, Sixth (Seventh) Fleet, and the CRTG defeated the forces of the SKYWARD cult, their AI-god Babylon and unknown interventionists, securing the final requirement for a treaty with the remnants of the Russian Federation - the destruction of the Eastern European HAARP Facility.

It is March 21st, 2036, a Friday. Tomorrow is supposed to be the second straight day of sun that Europe has seen in nearly twenty years. 

You have just received word that SKYWARD have a backup of Babylon and are on the move.

It was going to be such a nice day.


# Features

**Milsim TTRPG**: You're a grunt with a gun and a mission. Slap some peripherals on there, get some useful armor on and Roll them Bones.

**Singular Dice**: You only need d6s. Hell, you could get away with 1d6. We recommend 3d6 or... maybe a cube.

**Give and Take Combat**: Every fight you go into, every situation you encounter will initially massively disfavour you. It's up to you to leverage your stats, traits, knowledge and environment to overcome challenges.

**A New Kind of Apocalypse**: This isn't your grandpappy's nightmare. WWIII happened and while nukes got launched, MAD didn't happen. Turns out *we didn't need that shit anymore*. Fight bandits, cultists and God-AI while facing the Mother of All Storms and her radioactive Problem Children.
