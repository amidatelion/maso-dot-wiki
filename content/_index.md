{{< hint info >}}
MASO was, originally, a prototype tabletop roleplaying game that took its cues from Battletech, mecha anime, and [Lancer](https://massif-press.itch.io/corebook-pdf).  

This version... isn't that. It's purely an exploration of the infantry rules. Maybe some vehicles. It is set in Ignis Company's [HAARP universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie13GMC3fTA&list=PLmHznWsTk8BTJofMfAf_E4Ee0hxn0dURA) and blends its world with Shadowrun-inspired crunch and Tarkov-inspired survival mechanics.

## Features

**Milsim TTRPG**: You're a grunt with a gun and a mission. Slap some peripherals on there, get some useful armor on and Roll them Bones.

**Singular Dice**: You only need d6s. Hell, you could get away with 1d6. We recommend 3d6 or... maybe a cube.

**Give and Take Combat**: Every fight you go into, every situation you encounter will initially massively disfavour you. It's up to you to leverage your stats, traits, knowledge and environment to overcome challenges.

**A New Kind of Apocalypse**: This isn't your grandpappy's nightmare. WWIII happened and while nukes got launched, MAD didn't happen. Turns out *we didn't need that shit anymore*. Fight bandits, cultists and God-AI while facing the Mother of All Storms and her radioactive Problem Children.
